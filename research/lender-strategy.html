Your proposal must simultaneously protect lender recovery AND be attractive enough for management/board to agree.</p><hr/></div></div><div class="doc-article" id="art-1-lender-led-restructuring-mechanics"><div class="article-header">1. Lender-Led Restructuring Mechanics</div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-how-creditor-groups-initiate-and-drive-out-of-court-restructurings"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-title">How Creditor Groups Initiate and Drive Out-of-Court Restructurings</span></div><div class="research-text"><p>The process follows a well-established sequence that typically unfolds over 4-12 weeks from initial formation to term sheet:</p><p><strong>Phase 1: Identifying Distress and Forming the Ad Hoc Group (Weeks 1-3)</strong></p><ul>
<li><strong>Trigger events:</strong> Debt trading below par (AMC’s debt was trading at 75-90 cents pre-LME), upcoming maturity wall, covenant breaches, deteriorating EBITDA, liquidity runway shortening below 12-18 months</li>
<li><strong>Initial creditor coordination:</strong> One or more sophisticated creditors (typically distressed hedge funds or CLO managers) begin informal outreach to other holders of the same tranche</li>
<li><strong>Engaging counsel:</strong> The nascent group retains restructuring counsel who establishes a “common interest” privilege to allow information sharing</li>
<li><strong>Forming the ad hoc group:</strong> Once holders representing a critical mass (typically 33-50%+) of a given tranche are assembled, they formalize via a cooperation agreement</li>
<li><strong>Public vs. private:</strong> The group files a Rule 13d notice (for bonds) or may remain private (for loans). Going public signals seriousness but limits trading flexibility</li>
<li><strong>NDA and information access:</strong> The group requests the company enter into an NDA and provide non-public financial information, which begins the formal engagement</li>
</ul><p><strong>Phase 2: Analysis and Term Sheet Development (Weeks 3-6)</strong></p><ul>
<li>Group’s financial advisor builds an independent model of the company’s business, liquidity, and recovery waterfall</li>
<li>Legal counsel analyzes credit documents for: permitted investment baskets, incurrence capacity, restricted payment covenants, sacred rights, intercreditor agreement provisions, and “loose” language that creates LME opportunities</li>
<li>The group develops a “term sheet” outlining the proposed restructuring transaction</li>
<li>Internal group economics are negotiated (who contributes new money, how early consent fees are allocated, etc.)</li>
</ul><p><strong>Phase 3: Engagement with the Company (Weeks 5-10)</strong></p><ul>
<li>The ad hoc group approaches the company (typically through company-side advisors) with the term sheet</li>
<li>Negotiation ensues – this is an iterative process where terms are adjusted</li>
<li>The company may run a parallel process soliciting competing proposals from other creditor groups</li>
<li>Key leverage point: the group’s ability to block alternatives (if they hold enough debt) vs. the company’s ability to play creditor groups against each other</li>
</ul><p><strong>Phase 4: Documentation and Execution (Weeks 8-12+)</strong></p><ul>
<li>Once principal terms are agreed, legal counsel drafts the definitive documents</li>
<li>For exchange offers: preparation of offering memorandum, registration statements (if applicable), and amended credit documents</li>
<li>For amendments: preparation of consent solicitation materials</li>
<li>Execution: typically a 20-30 business day solicitation/exchange period</li>
<li>Closing conditions, minimum participation thresholds, and backstop arrangements are finalized</li>

</table><p><strong>What legal counsel does for the creditor group:</strong>
- <strong>Document analysis:</strong> Painstaking review of credit agreements, indentures, intercreditor agreements, and security documents to identify (a) covenants the company may be violating or approaching, (b) “loose” provisions that permit LME transactions, (c) sacred rights that protect minority lenders, and (d) amendment thresholds
- <strong>Structure design:</strong> Architects the legal mechanics of the LME (dropdown, uptier, exchange, amend-and-extend)
- <strong>Cooperation agreement:</strong> Drafts the agreement among ad hoc group members governing information sharing, trading restrictions, voting commitments, and new money obligations
- <strong>Litigation strategy:</strong> If necessary, prepares and files breach-of-contract or breach-of-fiduciary-duty claims</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-how-lenders-select-and-engage-with-company-management"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-title">How Lenders Select and Engage with Company Management</span></div><div class="research-text"><p>The approach matters enormously. The most successful creditor-driven restructurings involve early, constructive engagement rather than adversarial confrontation:</p><ol>
<li><strong>Initial contact:</strong> Typically through the company’s existing financial or legal advisors, or directly to the CFO/General Counsel. A letter from the ad hoc group’s counsel announcing the group’s formation and requesting engagement is the standard opening move.</li>
<li><strong>Information request:</strong> The group requests access to non-public information under an NDA. This is a critical test – companies that refuse to engage early often face more aggressive creditor tactics later.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborative framing:</strong> The initial communication should frame the group as a “solution provider” – “We are prepared to provide new capital and extend the company’s runway” is far more effective than “We intend to enforce our contractual rights.”</li>
<li><strong>Management meeting:</strong> Once an NDA is in place, a face-to-face meeting between the ad hoc group (typically 2-3 principals plus advisors) and management (CEO, CFO, General Counsel, plus company advisors) focuses on understanding management’s business plan and where the capital structure needs to go.</li>

Aligning Lender and Management Incentives</div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-the-fundamental-tension"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-title">The Fundamental Tension</span></div><div class="research-text"><p>Lenders want to maximize recovery on their claims. Management wants to preserve the enterprise, maintain their positions, and protect equity value. These interests are not inherently opposed – in fact, they often align more than either side initially realizes.</p><p><strong>The key insight for your case competition:</strong> The most successful LME proposals present management with a “better alternative to the current path.” If you can show that your proposal (a) extends the company’s runway, (b) reduces near-term cash obligations, (c) preserves management’s roles, and (d) avoids the stigma and disruption of bankruptcy, management has strong incentives to agree.</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-why-management-might-agree-to-an-lme"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-title">Why Management Might Agree to an LME</span></div><div class="research-text"><ol>
<li><strong>Avoiding Chapter 11:</strong> Management faces loss of control (potential CRO or trustee), intense scrutiny, professional stigma, potential personal liability, near-certain equity wipe-out, and rejection of employment contracts.</li>
<li><strong>Maturity wall relief:</strong> AMC faced nearly $3 billion in debt maturing before end of 2026. An LME that extends maturities gives management time to execute its business plan.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced cash interest burden:</strong> Converting cash-pay to PIK or reducing overall interest expense frees cash flow for operations.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity injection:</strong> If the LME includes new money (as Del Monte’s did with $240M), management gets desperately needed operating capital.</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining going concern value:</strong> AMC’s theaters have long-term leases, studio relationships, and brand value worth far more as a going concern than in liquidation.</li>
<li><strong>Preserving management equity:</strong> In many LMEs, management’s equity is preserved or enhanced through MIPs, whereas in Chapter 11, existing equity is typically wiped out.</li>
</ol></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-carrot-approaches-what-lenders-can-offer-management"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-title">“Carrot” Approaches – What Lenders Can Offer Management</span></div><div class="research-text"><p><strong>1. New Money Provision</strong>
- Commit to inject fresh capital (new term loans, revolving credit, or new notes) for operations
- Often the single most compelling element because it solves the immediate liquidity crisis
- Structure as a first-out tranche (highest repayment priority) giving lenders downside protection while providing the company cash
- Example: Del Monte’s LME raised $240M of new money through drop-down financing</p><p><strong>2. Management Incentive Plans (MIPs)</strong>
- Offer management equity in the restructured company
- Typical MIP pool: 5-10% of post-restructuring equity
- Include restricted stock, options, phantom equity, or profit-sharing
- Vesting: 3-4 years with time-based and performance-based triggers plus some upfront vesting for good faith
- <strong>This is critically important:</strong> Management’s willingness to cooperate correlates directly with whether they have an economic stake in the outcome</p><p><strong>3. Covenant Relief</strong>
- Relax financial covenants (leverage ratios, interest coverage, minimum liquidity) that the company is in danger of tripping
- Gives management operational breathing room
- In exchange, lenders get enhanced information rights and consent rights</p><p><strong>4. Maturity Extension</strong>
- Extending maturities from, say, 2026 to 2029-2031 removes the near-term refinancing cliff
- This was the primary objective of AMC’s July 2024 LME – reducing 2-year maturities from $2,781M to $362M</p><p><strong>5. Reduced Cash Interest Burden</strong>
- Converting some cash interest to PIK reduces cash outflows
- AMC’s Muvico 6.00%/8.00% Cash/PIK Toggle Notes allow choosing PIK when cash is tight
- Lenders sacrifice current yield but get higher total return (PIK compounds on larger principal)</p><p><strong>6. Operational Support</strong>
- Creditor-designated board members can be framed as “adding experienced directors” rather than “creditor oversight”
- Large distressed funds can offer operational expertise, industry contacts, and strategic guidance</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-stick-approaches-leverage-points-for-lenders"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-title">“Stick” Approaches – Leverage Points for Lenders</span></div><div class="research-text"><p><strong>1. Acceleration / Default Threats</strong>
- If the company is in default, lenders holding the Required Lender threshold (typically 50%+) can accelerate, triggering cross-defaults across the capital structure
- <strong>The threat is more powerful than the action.</strong> Actually accelerating often destroys value. The credible threat drives management to negotiate.</p><p><strong>2. Covenant Enforcement</strong>
- Refuse waivers for covenant violations, limiting operational flexibility
- Block consent for asset sales, acquisitions, additional debt, or restricted payments</p><p><strong>3. Blocking DIP Financing</strong>
- A creditor group controlling enough debt can control who provides DIP financing in any bankruptcy
- By offering or threatening to withhold DIP financing, lenders shape in-court restructuring terms
- Example: Del Monte’s participating lenders provided the DIP facility when it filed Ch.11 in July 2025</p><p><strong>4. Controlling the Narrative</strong>
- Organized creditors with sophisticated advisors can shape market perception
- A well-publicized creditor proposal pressures management to respond constructively</p><p><strong>5. Litigation Threats</strong>
- Breach of credit agreement claims (AMC excluded 1L noteholders filed in NY state court, Sept 2024)
- Breach of intercreditor agreement claims
- Delaware Section 225 actions to replace board members (Del Monte excluded lenders did this through Black Diamond)
- Fraudulent transfer and fiduciary duty claims</p><p><strong>6. Involuntary Bankruptcy</strong>
- Three or more creditors with qualifying claims can file an involuntary petition
- Nuclear option rarely used, but the threat is powerful</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-how-sponsors-factor-in-amc-specific"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-title">How Sponsors Factor In (AMC-Specific)</span></div><div class="research-text"><p>AMC has no PE sponsor. It is publicly traded with diffuse retail and institutional shareholders. Management is accountable to the board, which has fiduciary duties to shareholders (but in the zone of insolvency, duties shift to include creditors). CEO Adam Aron has strong personal incentives tied to compensation, reputation, and the “meme stock” retail base.</p><p><strong>Strategic implication for your pitch:</strong> With no PE sponsor to negotiate with, your proposal must appeal directly to the board’s fiduciary duties and management’s self-interest. The board is the key decision-maker.</p><hr/></div></div></div><div class="doc-article" id="art-3-transaction-structures-that-serve-both-sides"><div class="article-header">3.

<li><strong>Key design:</strong> Minimum participation threshold (50-66%), early bird consent fee (50-100 bps), and pro-rata vs. non-pro-rata structure (non-pro-rata is more aggressive, invites litigation)</li>

<li><strong>Company benefit:</strong> Fresh liquidity (the most compelling element), maturity extension, demonstrates investor confidence</li>
<li><strong>Typical AMC structure:</strong></li>

<li><strong>Lead with the business case, not legal threats.</strong> Open with: “We believe in the long-term viability of AMC’s business. We are prepared to provide the capital and runway needed to capitalize on the box office recovery.”</li>
<li><strong>Present a comprehensive solution, not demands.</strong> Show a fully-modeled proposal with pro forma balance sheet, liquidity runway, and debt service coverage.</li>
<li><strong>Make the “no deal” scenario clear but not threatening.</strong> Include a comparison: “Under the status quo, the company faces $X billion maturity wall with only $Y million liquidity. Our proposal extends maturities and injects $Z million.”</li>
<li><strong>Offer management a personal stake.</strong> MIP, employment agreements, severance protections convert management from adversary to aligned partner.</li>

<p>Detailed analysis of prepackaged and pre-arranged Chapter 11 mechanics, RSA (Restructuring Support Agreement) frameworks, DIP financing, and Section 363 credit bid backstop strategies has been consolidated into the <a href=”court-solutions.html”><strong>Court Solutions &amp; Bankruptcy Analysis</strong></a> research page. Key topics covered there include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepack vs. pre-arranged vs. free-fall Chapter 11 comparison</li>
<li>RSA negotiation and plan solicitation under Section 1126(b)</li>
<li>DIP financing under Section 364 with AMC-specific provisions (DOC 4 Section 9.02(b)(x) pro rata participation rights)</li>
<li>363 asset sales, stalking horse procedures, and credit bidding under Section 363(k)</li>
<li>Recovery comparison across all in-court pathways by tranche</li>

<li><strong>Transaction:</strong> Drop-down of 175 domestic theaters + IP to Muvico (unrestricted subsidiary)</li>
<li><strong>Excluded:</strong> $950M 1L notes (7.5% due 2029)</li>
<li><strong>Litigation:</strong> NY state court breach claims (Sept 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> July 2025 TSA – excluded noteholders provided new money and exchanged into third-priority Muvico debt</li>
<li><strong>Credit metrics:</strong> Total debt $4,307M to $4,331M (unchanged); net leverage 9.1x to 9.2x; near-term maturities $2,781M to $362M (primary goal achieved)</li>
<li><strong>Lesson:</strong> Primarily a maturity management exercise, not a deleveraging. Excluded creditors ultimately made out well through litigation leverage.</li>

<li><strong>Transaction:</strong> Drop-down of substantially ALL assets to DMFC II; $240M new money</li>
<li><strong>Excluded:</strong> ~15% holdouts led by Black Diamond</li>
<li><strong>Litigation:</strong> Delaware Section 225 proceeding (novel – replaced board through voting pledged stock)</li>
<li><strong>Settlement:</strong> April 2025 – excluded lenders repaid at par plus $20M fees</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Filed Chapter 11 in July 2025 despite the LME</li>
<li><strong>Key lessons:</strong> (1) Delaware Section 225 approach was faster than NY breach litigation; (2) excluded lenders arguably came out better than participants; (3) LMEs providing only short-term liquidity fixes may just delay bankruptcy; (4) new money is critical</li>

|
+-- Does management recognize the problem?
|   |
|   +-- YES --&gt; Engage constructively
|   |   +-- Liquidity crisis? --&gt; New money + exchange (urgency = leverage)
|   |   +-- No crisis? --------&gt; Amend-and-extend with governance (patience)
|   |   +-- PE sponsor? -------&gt; Negotiate with sponsor first
|   |   +-- No sponsor? -------&gt; Negotiate with board; emphasize fiduciary duties
|   |
|   +-- NO --&gt; Increase pressure
|       +-- Have Required Lender threshold? --&gt; Threaten acceleration
|       +-- Building coalition? ------------&gt; File litigation for leverage
|       +-- Covenant violation? ------------&gt; Refuse waiver; demand talks
|
+-- WHAT IS THE PRIMARY PROBLEM?
|   +-- Maturity wall --------&gt; Amend-and-extend or exchange
|   +-- Excess leverage ------&gt; Debt-for-equity or discounted exchange
|   +-- Liquidity crisis -----&gt; New money + exchange
|   +-- Operational issues ---&gt; New money + governance + management change
|   +-- All of the above -----&gt; Comprehensive restructuring with in-court backstop
|
+-- AGGRESSIVENESS SPECTRUM
    +-- Drop-down: Most aggressive; expect litigation
    +-- Uptier: Aggressive; post-Serta, riskier legally
    +-- Non-pro-rata exchange: Moderately aggressive
    +-- Pro-rata exchange: Cooperative; max participation
    +-- Amend-and-extend: Least aggressive; business fundamentally sound
