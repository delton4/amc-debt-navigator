This guide catalogs every major countermeasure, its mechanics, known limitations, and current market adoption.</p><p><strong>Critical Context for AMC:</strong> AMC Entertainment executed multiple LME-style transactions during 2020-2024, including exchange offers, new secured note issuances, and subsidiary-level financing (Muvico LLC, Odeon Finco PLC). Understanding these provisions is essential for evaluating AMC’s capital structure from a lender’s perspective.</p><hr/></div></div><div class="doc-article" id="art-2-anti-serta-anti-uptier-provisions"><div class="article-header">2.

Non-participating minority lenders were effectively subordinated without their consent. The majority argued this was permissible under standard amendment provisions requiring only majority lender approval.</p><p><strong>How it works mechanically:</strong>
1. Borrower identifies willing majority lenders (typically &gt;50% but &lt;100%)
2. Majority lenders amend the credit agreement to (a) create a new “superpriority” lien basket, and (b) modify the intercreditor/waterfall provisions
3. Majority lenders roll existing loans into the new superpriority tranche, often with a small new money component
4. Non-participating lenders are subordinated – their first-lien loans are now effectively second-lien</p><p><strong>Key precedent:</strong> In Serta Simmons, the Southern District of New York initially dismissed the excluded lenders’ claims (2022), but this was later reversed on appeal. The case eventually resulted in a bankruptcy filing where the priming was contested. In Mitel Networks (2023), a similar uptier was executed.

of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby:

(a) subordinate the Liens securing the Obligations to the Liens securing any
    other Indebtedness, or subject the Liens securing the Obligations to any
    new or additional Liens (other than Permitted Liens) that are senior to or
    pari passu with the Liens securing the Obligations;

(b) subordinate the Obligations in right of payment to any other Indebtedness;

(c) alter the pro rata sharing or pro rata payment provisions of this Agreement
    in a manner adverse to such Lender (including by authorizing or permitting
    any "open market purchase" or "Dutch auction" or similar transaction that
    does not comply with the pro rata provisions herein);

(d) change the payment waterfall in a manner that would reduce the priority of
    any payment owed to any Lender relative to any other creditor;

(e) release all or substantially all of the Collateral or all or substantially
    all of the Guarantors (other than in connection with a transaction
    permitted by this Agreement);

(f) permit the incurrence of any Indebtedness that is secured on a senior
    basis to the Obligations without the consent of each Lender affected
    thereby.
</code></pre><p><strong>Strongest formulation (2024-2025 “belt and suspenders” approach):</strong></p><pre><code>Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no amendment, modification,
supplement, waiver, or consent shall:

(i) have the effect of (A) subordinating, or permitting the subordination of,
    the Obligations or the Liens securing the Obligations to any other
    Indebtedness or Liens, whether through an uptier, priming, or similar
    transaction, (B) allowing any creditor to receive priority in respect of
    any Collateral distributions over any Lender, or (C) otherwise modifying
    the relative priorities among the Lenders, in each case, without the
    written consent of each Lender adversely affected thereby;

(ii) for the avoidance of doubt, neither the Required Lenders nor any other
     group of Lenders (other than all affected Lenders) shall have the right
     to (A) subordinate the Liens on the Collateral securing any Lender's
     Obligations to Liens securing any other obligations, (B) subordinate
     any Lender's Obligations in right of payment to other obligations, or
     (C) contractually redirect any Lender's right to receive proceeds of
     Collateral or other amounts to any other creditor, in each case without
     the consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected.
</code></pre><h4 id="222-affected-lender-vs-each-lender-consent">2.2.2 “Affected Lender” vs. “Each Lender” Consent</h4><p><strong>Critical distinction:</strong> The strongest provisions require consent of “each Lender directly and adversely affected” rather than “each Lender” (unanimous) or “Required Lenders” (majority).

<li><strong>“Each Lender”</strong> (unanimous) – Can be circumvented by buying out or “yanking” dissenting lenders</li>
<li><strong>“Required Lenders”</strong> (majority) – Precisely the vulnerability Serta exploited</li>

    the Required Lenders (a "Non-Consenting Lender"), provided that:

What was once considered “aggressive lender protection” is now market standard in new issuances.</p><p><strong>Tier 1: Nearly Universal (&gt;80% of new BSL deals):</strong>
- Anti-uptier / anti-Serta sacred rights
- J.Crew blockers (IP transfer restrictions)
- Expanded sacred rights covering lien priority and payment waterfall
- Pro-rata treatment requirements for prepayments
- Restrictions on yank-a-bank for sacred right matters</p><p><strong>Tier 2: Common (50-80% of new BSL deals):</strong>
- Anti-double-dip covenants
- Anti-non-pro-rata exchange provisions
- MFN protections for incremental facilities
- Anti-stacking provisions for investment baskets
- Enhanced reporting requirements for asset transfers to unrestricted subs</p><p><strong>Tier 3: Growing but Not Yet Standard (25-50% of new BSL deals):</strong>
- Comprehensive anti-dropdown provisions (beyond just IP)
- Restrictions on intercompany loans creating structural priority
- Enhanced cooperation mechanics embedded in credit agreements themselves
- “Anti-Chewy” provisions (restricting subsidiary IPO proceeds leakage)</p><p><strong>Tier 4: Emerging (&lt;25% of new BSL deals):</strong>
- Automatic springing cooperation mechanics upon distress triggers
- Anti-aggregation provisions (restricting single lender from accumulating blocking positions for LME purposes)
- “Anti-Incora” provisions (comprehensive structural subordination protections)
- Mandatory mediation provisions before LME execution</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-92-direct-lending-vs-bsl-documentation"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-number">9.2</span><span class="section-title">Direct Lending vs. BSL Documentation</span></div><div class="research-text"><table class="research-table">

- S&amp;P published updated criteria in 2023-2024 explicitly addressing LME risk in leveraged loan ratings
- Rating agencies now evaluate documentation quality as a ratings factor – weak documentation provisions can result in a ratings notch-down or negative CreditWatch
- “Recovery ratings” now incorporate LME vulnerability; weak docs = lower recovery assumptions
- S&amp;P introduced the concept of “selective default” treatment for certain LMEs, which can trigger CDS acceleration and CLO compliance issues</p><p><strong>CLO Managers:</strong>
- CLO indentures increasingly include “anti-LME” provisions:
  - Restrictions on CLO managers participating in uptier transactions without noteholder consent
  - Requirements that CLO managers not consent to sacred right waivers
  - Limitations on CLO managers entering into cooperation agreements that would restrict trading
- LSTA (Loan Syndications and Trading Association) published model documentation in 2023-2024 addressing LME protections
- CLO compliance testing now includes documentation quality assessments
- Several CLO managers (Ares, Golub, Owl Rock) have publicly stated they will not invest in deals without minimum documentation protections</p><p><strong>Key CLO-specific tension:</strong> CLOs face a conflict between (a) the economic incentive to participate in an uptier (getting priority position) and (b) fiduciary duties to all CLO noteholders and the broader portfolio effect of legitimizing LME precedents. This tension has led to litigation and intra-CLO disputes.</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-94-regulatory-developments"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-number">9.4</span><span class="section-title">Regulatory Developments</span></div><div class="research-text"><ul>
<li><strong>SEC scrutiny:</strong> The SEC has examined disclosure practices around LMEs, particularly whether selective exchange offers comply with securities laws when some creditors receive MNPI</li>
<li><strong>Bankruptcy reform proposals:</strong> Several legislative proposals have been discussed (but not yet enacted) to address the treatment of LME transactions in bankruptcy, including potential preference and fraudulent transfer implications</li>
<li><strong>Bank regulatory guidance:</strong> The Fed, OCC, and FDIC’s 2023 Leveraged Lending Guidance update references documentation risk as a factor in bank leveraged lending examinations</li>

- <strong>Lender-side response:</strong> “Anti-evasion” provisions that look at substance over form; aggregate transaction testing; mandatory disclosure of planned multi-step transactions; “purpose” tests for basket utilization
- <strong>Technology adoption:</strong> Lenders are increasingly using data analytics to identify documentation weaknesses before committing capital; law firms have developed proprietary LME vulnerability scoring tools

<li>
<p><strong>Multi-tranche complexity:</strong> AMC’s capital structure involves multiple tranches of secured notes (7.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 at both AMC and Muvico, 6.00%/8.00% PIK Toggle at Muvico, 12.75% Senior Secured Notes at Odeon), each with potentially different covenant packages. Cross-document analysis is essential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unrestricted subsidiary risk:</strong> Odeon Finco PLC operates as a distinct legal entity with its own indenture. The relationship between Odeon and AMC parent creates potential dropdown/leakage risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exchange offer history:</strong> AMC has a history of executing exchange offers (converting equity, exchanging notes). Future exchanges could disadvantage non-participating lenders if pro-rata protections are weak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collateral segregation:</strong> With assets spread across AMC Holdings, Muvico LLC, and Odeon Finco PLC, collateral pooling vs. segregation significantly affects recovery analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intercreditor considerations:</strong> The relative priority among the various secured note issuances depends on intercreditor agreements. Lenders should map the complete priority waterfall.</p>
