<li><strong>Maturity extension</strong> – pushing out near-term debt walls</li>
<li><strong>Debt reduction</strong> – exchanging debt at a discount to par</li>
<li><strong>Priority elevation</strong> – moving a creditor group ahead of others in the waterfall</li>

<li>A borrower identifies that its credit agreement allows amendments with consent of “Required Lenders” (typically 50.1% of outstanding principal)</li>
<li>The borrower secretly negotiates with a majority group of lenders</li>
<li>The majority group agrees to provide new money and/or exchange into new super-priority debt</li>
<li>Using their majority vote, they amend the credit agreement to permit the new priming debt</li>
<li>Minority/excluded lenders are subordinated – their formerly pari passu claims now sit behind the new super-priority tranche</li>
</ol><h3 id="credit-agreement-provisions-exploited">Credit Agreement Provisions Exploited:</h3><ul>
<li><strong>“Required Lenders” amendment threshold</strong> – Most credit agreements allow non-sacred-right amendments with just majority lender consent</li>
<li><strong>“Open market purchase” exceptions</strong> – Allow non-pro-rata debt repurchases, which the Serta court interpreted to include private exchanges with select lenders</li>
<li><strong>Incremental facility provisions</strong> – Permit new debt under ratio-based or free-and-clear baskets</li>
<li><strong>“Permitted Indebtedness” baskets</strong> – Allow new debt that can be structured as super-priority</li>
</ul><h3 id="key-deal-serta-simmons-2020">Key Deal: Serta Simmons (2020)</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Pre-transaction</strong>: $1.95B first lien term loan + $450M second lien term loan</li>
<li><strong>Transaction</strong>: Serta worked with approximately 57% of first lien lenders and approximately 73% of second lien lenders to create new “super-priority” first-out and second-out tranches</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism</strong>: Participating lenders exchanged existing debt at par for new super-priority positions and provided $200M in new money</li>
<li><strong>Impact on excluded lenders</strong>: Non-participating first lien lenders saw their claims effectively subordinated behind approximately $2B of new super-priority debt</li>
<li><strong>Fifth Circuit Ruling (December 2023)</strong>: In <em>LCM XXII v. Serta Simmons</em>, the Fifth Circuit found that the “open market purchase” provision did not authorize the non-pro-rata exchange – it requires arm’s-length, market-based transactions. This was a pyrrhic victory because Serta had already filed Chapter 11 in January 2023, but the ruling has chilled future reliance on “open market purchase” provisions for uptier transactions.</li>
</ul><h3 id="key-deal-boardriders-quiksilver-2020">Key Deal: Boardriders / Quiksilver (2020)</h3><ul>
<li>Oaktree Capital (majority lender) orchestrated a priming transaction</li>
<li>Provided new super-priority financing, subordinating minority lenders</li>
<li>Excluded lenders (including Brigade Capital) sued, alleging breach of the implied covenant of good faith</li>
<li>Settled confidentially, but set the template for sponsor-aligned creditor violence</li>
</ul><h3 id="key-deal-trimark-2021">Key Deal: TriMark (2021)</h3><ul>
<li>Private equity sponsor Centerbridge worked with majority lenders</li>
<li>New super-priority term loan was issued; minority lenders were primed</li>
<li>Court found the transaction did not violate the credit agreement’s express terms, even though it disadvantaged minority lenders</li>

<li>Form early, often at the direction of a distressed debt hedge fund or the PE sponsor</li>
<li>Sign cooperation agreements binding members to act together</li>
<li>Negotiate as a bloc with the borrower</li>
<li><strong>Advantage</strong>: First-mover advantage in shaping the LME; typically get best exchange terms, pro-rata participation rights, and new money opportunities</li>
</ul><h3 id="non-cooperative-excluded-groups">Non-Cooperative / Excluded Groups</h3><ul>
<li>Lenders who are either not invited, refuse the terms offered, or learn about the transaction too late</li>
<li>Left holding subordinated, stripped, or value-impaired claims</li>
<li><strong>Defensive Options</strong>:</li>
<li>File breach of contract lawsuits (NY state court typical venue)</li>
<li>Use Delaware Section 225 proceedings to challenge board composition (novel Del Monte approach)</li>
<li>Appoint new agent and call defaults</li>
<li>Negotiate for settlement payments (often at par or par plus)</li>
<li>Accumulate enough debt to block “Required Lenders” threshold</li>
</ul><h3 id="lessons-from-amc-and-del-monte-2024-2025">Lessons from AMC and Del Monte (2024-2025):</h3><p><strong>AMC excluded 1L noteholders</strong>: Filed a traditional NY state court lawsuit alleging breach of the intercreditor agreement. Settled in July 2025 – excluded noteholders got to exchange into new third-priority Muvico debt, guaranteed by AMC Entertainment Holdings at par, plus the opportunity to provide new money.</p><p><strong>Del Monte excluded lenders</strong>: Took the novel approach of replacing the agent with Black Diamond, calling a default, voting pledged stock to replace the board, and filing a Delaware Section 225 proceeding. This moved at extraordinary speed – two-day trial within approximately six months. Settled in April 2025 with excluded lenders getting par plus $20M in fees ($122M total repayment funded by new incremental facility from participating lenders).</p><p><strong>Critical Lesson</strong>: The Del Monte excluded lenders arguably got a <em>better</em> outcome than participating lenders, who ended up tied to a company that filed for Chapter 11 in July 2025. Excluded lenders were paid at par and walked away clean. The term loan had been trading at about 75 cents on the dollar prior to the 2024 LME.</p><hr/></div></div></div><div class="doc-article" id="art-3-cooperation-agreements"><div class="article-header">3.

(DMPL). Because of DMPL’s preferred stock, DM Intermediate was not a “wholly-owned domestic subsidiary” and therefore excluded from the mandatory guarantee requirement.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: DMFI transfers substantially all assets to DM Intermediate using Section 6.6(b)(ii)(x) of the credit agreement, which permits <strong>uncapped</strong> investments in “the Parent Guarantors, the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary.”</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: DM Intermediate transfers substantially all assets to DM Intermediate II using Section 6.6(b)(ii)(y), which permits investments “by any Subsidiary that is not a Credit Party in another Subsidiary that is not a Credit Party.”</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Assets reach Del Monte Foods Corporation II (DMFC II), an unrestricted subsidiary, which issues new debt:
- $269M Super-Priority First-Out (SPFO)
- $467M Super-Priority Second-Out (SPSO)<br/>
- $139M Super-Priority Third-Out (SPTO) – for non-ad-hoc group lenders who contributed new money

- <strong>Uncapped restricted subsidiary investment basket</strong> (vs. J.Crew’s capped $150M basket)
- <strong>“Trapdoor” / “proceeds” basket</strong> allowing investments by non-Credit Party subsidiaries in other non-Credit Party subsidiaries on an uncapped basis
- <strong>60-day grace period for subsidiary guarantees</strong> – transactions completed before DM Intermediate was required to become a guarantor
- <strong>Preferred stock to foreign affiliate</strong> – made DM Intermediate “not wholly owned” to exclude it from guarantee requirements

- Del Monte filed Chapter 11 in July 2025
- Excluded lenders arguably did better than participants</p><h3 id="the-amc-muvico-dropdown-july-2024">The AMC Muvico Dropdown (July 2024):</h3><p><strong>Exact Mechanics:</strong></p><ol>
<li>AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMCEH) creates Muvico LLC as an unrestricted subsidiary</li>
<li>175 domestic theaters (approximately 53% of TTM EBITDA) plus AMC’s IP are transferred to Muvico</li>
<li>Participating 1L term lenders ($1,865M, 98% participation) exchange at par into new Muvico 1L term loan due 2029 (SOFR+600-700)</li>
<li>Participating 2L PIK Toggle holders exchange $104M principal into Muvico TL and $414M into Muvico PIK Toggle Convertible Note due 2030</li>
<li>New Muvico debt is secured on all AMC assets transferred to Muvico</li>
<li>Muvico debt benefits from guarantee of AMC Entertainment Holdings (the parent)</li>
<li>Excluded 1L noteholders (7.5% notes due 2029, $950M) are left at AMCEH level with claims on remaining assets</li>
</ol><p><strong>Key difference from Del Monte</strong>: AMC dropped down only approximately 40-50% of assets (vs. Del Monte’s approximately 100%), and AMC did NOT raise new money. The AMC transaction was purely a maturity extension mechanism, exploiting expansive value leakage and debt incurrence capacity under the excluded first lien notes’ documents. The transaction was pro rata as to the first lien term loans, so no “open market purchase” exploit was needed.</p><p><strong>Intercreditor Agreement Dispute</strong>: The central legal battle was whether the ICA between 1L and 2L noteholders survived the transaction. AMC argued it “ceased to be effective” when 2L noteholders released their collateral. Excluded 1L noteholders argued the ICA remained because the notes were “refinanced” not “discharged.” The February 2025 excluded-noteholder brief argued the ICA “shall continue to be effective <em>until the Discharge of Senior Obligations shall have occurred</em>” and the notes were refinanced, not discharged.</p><p><strong>Settlement (July 2025)</strong>: Excluded 7.5% noteholders agreed to provide new money to AMC and exchange their notes for new third-priority debt at Muvico guaranteed by AMCEH at par. The bonds had been trading at approximately 90 cents on the dollar prior to the LME.</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-52-pari-plus-and-super-priority-structures"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-number">5.2</span><span class="section-title">“Pari-Plus” and “Super-Priority” Structures</span></div><div class="research-text"><h3 id="definition">Definition:</h3><p>A “pari-plus” or “super-priority” structure creates a new tranche of debt that ranks ahead of existing first lien debt in the priority waterfall.</p><h3 id="structural-variants">Structural Variants:</h3><p><strong>First-Out / Last-Out Structures:</strong>

<li><strong>Direct Loan (Claim 1)</strong>: Lender makes a loan to the parent holding company, secured by the parent’s assets</li>
<li><strong>Intercompany Loan</strong>: The parent on-lends the proceeds to an operating subsidiary via an intercompany loan</li>
<li><strong>Structural Claim (Claim 2)</strong>: The lender takes a security interest in the parent’s intercompany loan receivable. In bankruptcy, this intercompany receivable gives the lender an additional claim at the subsidiary level</li>
<li><strong>Result</strong>: The lender effectively has two claims – one direct against the parent, and one indirect (through the intercompany loan) against the subsidiary – for a single advance of capital</li>
</ol><h3 id="triple-dip-extension">Triple-Dip Extension:</h3><p>Add another level of intercompany lending through an intermediate holding company. The lender ends up with three claims in the group for one advance.</p><h3 id="credit-agreement-provisions-exploited_1">Credit Agreement Provisions Exploited:</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Permitted indebtedness baskets</strong> allowing intercompany loans</li>
<li><strong>Permitted liens</strong> provisions allowing security interests in intercompany receivables</li>
<li><strong>Lack of specific prohibitions</strong> on multiple-claim structures in older credit agreements</li>
</ul><h3 id="key-context-european-origins">Key Context – European Origins:</h3><p>Double-dip structures were first popularized in European leveraged finance (particularly under English law credit agreements). They became more common in U.S. markets in 2023-2025 as lenders sought enhanced protections.</p><h3 id="deal-example-altice-france-2024">Deal Example: Altice France (2024)</h3><ul>
<li>One of the most prominent double-dip structures in recent memory</li>
<li>Complex corporate structure spanning France, Luxembourg, and other jurisdictions</li>
<li>Lenders structured intercompany loans giving them claims at multiple levels</li>
<li>When Altice France deteriorated, double-dip structures became central to creditor recovery analysis</li>
</ul><h3 id="defensive-provisions-to-watch-for">Defensive Provisions to Watch For:</h3><p>Modern credit agreements increasingly include:
- <strong>“Double-dip” blockers</strong> prohibiting intercompany loans that create additional creditor claims
- <strong>Limitations on security interests in intercompany receivables</strong>
- <strong>“Anti-layering” provisions</strong> restricting creation of priority debt
- <strong>“J.Crew blockers”</strong> limiting transfers to unrestricted subsidiaries</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-54-intercompany-loan-schemes"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-number">5.4</span><span class="section-title">Intercompany Loan Schemes</span></div><div class="research-text"><h3 id="how-they-are-weaponized-in-lmes">How They Are Weaponized in LMEs:</h3><ol>
<li><strong>Value extraction via intercompany lending</strong>: A borrower makes loans to affiliates or unrestricted subsidiaries, moving cash out of the credit group while creating receivables that are technically assets</li>
<li><strong>Priority manipulation</strong>: New lenders take security interests in intercompany loan receivables, getting a claim that is structurally senior to existing creditors at the subsidiary level</li>
<li><strong>Collateral dilution</strong>: The intercompany loan receivable replaces hard assets in the collateral package, as cash flows to unrestricted subs where existing creditors have no claims</li>
</ol><p>The AMC LME structure involved intercompany relationships between AMCEH and Muvico. While the Octus article notes “intercompany loans not shown” in the transaction diagram, the structure created an intercompany dynamic where assets at Muvico were beyond the reach of excluded AMCEH creditors.</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-55-the-consensual-dropdown-no-amendment-model"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-number">5.5</span><span class="section-title">The “Consensual Dropdown” – No-Amendment Model</span></div><div class="research-text"><p>This is perhaps the single most important innovation of 2024. Del Monte pioneered a dropdown that required NO amendment to existing credit documents. The entire transaction was accomplished within existing contractual permissions.</p><p><strong>Why this matters</strong>: Sacred rights – which protect against amendments to payment terms and collateral – do NOT protect against actions taken within existing permissions. A company can strip substantially all collateral from existing lenders without amending a single document, if the credit agreement’s investment baskets are permissive enough.</p><p>This is why the Octus article labeled it the “Del Monte Black Hole” – the combination of an uncapped restricted subsidiary investment basket and a proceeds/trapdoor basket created a bottomless pathway for asset transfer.</p><hr/></div></div></div><div class="doc-article" id="art-6-distressed-exchanges-with-consent-solicitations"><div class="article-header">6.

- If AMC deteriorates further, provide DIP financing and credit bid in bankruptcy (Del Monte playbook)
- Consider whether the Muvico TL springing maturity (October 5, 2028 per the pitch deck) creates additional leverage</p><p><strong>Option B: If You Hold the Excluded 1L Notes (Now 1.25L/1.5L at Muvico/AMCEH)</strong>
- Post-settlement, you are third-priority – behind Muvico 1L TL and behind the new 1.25L notes
- Your leverage is diminished but the guarantee from AMCEH provides a structural backstop
- Monitor for operational improvement; the 2025 movie slate is strong
- If the company continues to improve, hold-to-maturity or sell-at-premium may be optimal</p><p><strong>Option C: Propose New Money Injection for Enhanced Priority</strong>
- Offer additional liquidity to AMC in exchange for enhanced priority position
- Structure as incremental first-out term loan at Muvico
- This positions the lender for loan-to-own if the company files for bankruptcy
- The Del Monte model shows how new money providers can position for a credit bid</p><p><strong>Option D: Cooperative Comprehensive Restructuring</strong>
- Propose an out-of-court restructuring addressing the full capital structure
- Require all creditor classes to participate
- Pair debt reduction with operational restructuring
- Strongest case if 2025-2026 box office recovery materializes, reducing the need for aggressive tactics</p><hr/></div></div></div><div class="doc-article" id="art-appendix-a-glossary-of-key-lme-terms"><div class="article-header">Appendix A: Glossary of Key LME Terms</div><div class="research-text"><table class="research-table">

</table><hr/><p>This document draws on the Octus (formerly Reorg) article from August 25, 2025 (in your <code>/Users/diego/school/binghamton-non-school/BRx/Spring26CaseComp/Case Competition Materials (AMC) 2/AMC and Del Monte LMEs_ Transactions and Bankruptcy Impact.pdf</code>), your team’s existing pitch materials (<code>/Users/diego/school/binghamton-non-school/BRx/Spring26CaseComp/Case Competition Materials (AMC) 2/Distressed+Asset+Class+Pitch.pdf</code>), and extensive knowledge of leveraged finance and restructuring practice through mid-2025. I was unable to access WebSearch or WebFetch for real-time 2025-2026 data, so some of the most recent transactions (late 2025 through early 2026) may not be captured. If you can grant WebSearch/WebFetch permissions, I can supplement with the very latest developments.</p></div></div>
