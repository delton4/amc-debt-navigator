Why Odeon 12.750% Notes Likely Trade Above Par</div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-21-coupon-premium-vs-market-rates"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-number">2.1</span><span class="section-title">Coupon Premium vs. Market Rates</span></div><div class="research-text"><ul>
<li>A <strong>12.750% fixed coupon</strong> is exceptionally high for senior secured paper. Even in the elevated rate environment of 2023-2025, comparable European high-yield secured notes typically carry coupons in the 6-9% range.</li>
<li>This coupon was set at issuance in October 2022, during peak rate uncertainty and distressed cinema-sector sentiment. It reflects the risk premium demanded at that moment.</li>
<li>As box office recovery materialized and cinema-sector fundamentals stabilized, the risk premium embedded in the coupon became excessive relative to actual performance — driving the price above par.</li>
</ul></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-22-post-covid-cinema-recovery"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-number">2.2</span><span class="section-title">Post-COVID Cinema Recovery</span></div><div class="research-text"><ul>
<li>Global box office recovered significantly in 2023-2024, with major tentpole releases (Barbie, Oppenheimer, etc.) driving attendance.</li>
<li>Odeon operates across UK, Nordics (Filmstaden), Germany (UCI), Spain (Cinesa), and Finland (Finnkino) — diversified European exposure that benefited from this recovery.</li>
<li>Improved EBITDA and cash flow generation reduced credit risk below what was priced at issuance.</li>
</ul></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-23-call-protection-make-whole"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-number">2.3</span><span class="section-title">Call Protection / Make-Whole</span></div><div class="research-text"><ul>
<li>If the indenture includes standard non-call provisions with a make-whole premium (typical for high-yield notes), the issuer cannot refinance cheaply. This protects investors’ above-market coupon stream.</li>
<li>The <strong>Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio</strong> test steps up from 1.50x (through Dec 2023) to 2.00x (after), combined with a <strong>First Lien Leverage Ratio cap of 3.00x</strong>, indicating the structure was designed for a recovering credit.</li>

<li>These notes sit at the <strong>top of the capital structure</strong> as first-lien senior secured.</li>
<li>Collateral package includes shares, IP (Odeon, Filmstaden, UCI, Cinesa, Finnkino brands), bank accounts, receivables, insurance, and floating charges over UK/Finnish entity assets.</li>
<li>The Intercreditor Agreement explicitly provides for ranking priority: Senior Secured &gt; Second Lien &gt; Senior Unsecured &gt; Investor Liabilities.</li>

<li>Odeon is AMC’s entire European operation. A sale of Odeon has been periodically rumored, which could trigger a change-of-control put or early redemption at premium prices.</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Ministerial Only</strong>: The Security Agent acts “solely in a ministerial and administrative capacity” — it has NO obligation to monitor compliance, no duty to investigate defaults, and no independent judgment role.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Fiduciary Duties</strong>: Expressly stated that the Security Agent owes no fiduciary duties to any Holder or other secured party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ICA Controls</strong>: In case of any conflict between the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, <strong>the ICA prevails</strong>. The Security Agent follows ICA instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Instructing Group Directs</strong>: The Security Agent acts on directions from the “Instructing Group” (defined in the ICA — typically a majority of senior secured creditors by exposure). It has no independent enforcement discretion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Co-Agents &amp; Delegates</strong>: The Security Agent may appoint any number of co-security agents, sub-agents, or attorneys — common in multi-jurisdictional European structures where local agents are needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Indemnification</strong>: The Security Agent is entitled to full indemnification before taking any action. It can refuse to act if not indemnified to its satisfaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Liability</strong>: Not liable for any loss unless caused by its own gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud. Not liable for any delegate’s acts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dual Role</strong>: U.S. Bank serves as BOTH Trustee (US-style role for noteholder relations) AND Security Agent (UK-style role for collateral). This dual structure is common in cross-border deals.</p>
</li>

- The Security Agent <strong>cannot independently block</strong> a transaction — it follows ICA instructions.
- The <strong>Instructing Group</strong> threshold determines who controls enforcement. Capturing this majority is critical.
- The Security Agent’s ministerial role means it will execute whatever the Instructing Group directs, including releasing collateral, consenting to amendments, or enforcing — making the ICA the true battleground document.
- Any creditor-on-creditor violence must navigate the ICA’s consent thresholds, not just the indenture’s.</p><hr/></div></div></div><div class="doc-article" id="art-4-agreed-security-principles-exhibit-d-full-analysis"><div class="article-header">4.

<li>
<p><strong>Corporate Benefit / Financial Assistance</strong>: Guarantees and security limited to the maximum amount permissible under local corporate law — including capital maintenance rules, financial assistance prohibitions, “thin capitalization” rules, and fiduciary duties of directors. (Para 2(a))</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost-Benefit Test</strong>: Security NOT required if legal fees, registration fees, stamp duty, or taxes are “disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the Finance Parties.” (Para 2(c))</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Materiality Threshold</strong>: Only “material assets” in a category need be secured if securing all assets would be costly. (Para 2(d))</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Third-Party Consent Barriers</strong>: Assets subject to contractual restrictions (leases, licenses, JV agreements, cash pools) are excluded if charging them would give a third party termination rights. Obligors must use “reasonable efforts” for 45 days to obtain consent, then the obligation ceases. (Para 2(e))</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Legal Capacity</strong>: No security if it would be outside the Obligor’s legal capacity, result in a void document, or create personal liability for directors/officers. (Para 2(f))</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unduly Burdensome</strong>: No security if it would “restrict the ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course.” (Para 2(g))</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>German Tax Protection</strong>: No security that would trigger German non-resident tax liability or withholding tax deduction for lenders. (Para 2(p))</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Real Estate</strong>: Obligors are NOT required to grant security over real estate (though it may be captured by floating charges). No title investigation, surveys, or environmental due diligence required. (Para 12)</p>

<li>
<p><strong>The ASPs are a shield</strong>: The extensive carve-outs mean the actual security package is narrower than it appears. A lender must understand exactly what collateral is actually perfected and enforceable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multi-jurisdictional complexity</strong>: Any enforcement must navigate 6+ jurisdictions simultaneously. The ASPs acknowledge this is impractical — which is why European restructurings tend toward consensual solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Floating charges are powerful but subordinate</strong>: In UK insolvency, floating charges crystallize but rank behind fixed charges and preferential creditors. The prescribed part (a portion set aside for unsecured creditors) further dilutes recovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Declared Default is a binary switch</strong>: Until acceleration, secured creditors have almost no enforcement power. This creates significant negotiating dynamics — the threat of acceleration is the leverage, not the actual security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost provisions favor the borrower</strong>: The ASPs’ cost-benefit tests give the company significant discretion to argue that perfecting or enforcing security is “disproportionate” — a litigation hook in any enforcement scenario.</p>

<p><strong>Consent Solicitation</strong>: Seek covenant amendments in exchange for a consent fee. The above-par trading suggests holders are comfortable — making consent solicitations feasible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tender Offer</strong>: Issuer could offer to repurchase notes at a premium to par, funded by lower-cost refinancing. The 12.750% coupon creates strong economic incentive to refinance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exchange Offer</strong>: Offer new notes with longer maturity or different terms in exchange for existing notes. The approaching 2027 maturity creates a natural refinancing event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drop-Down / Asset Transfer</strong>: The structural ring-fencing and ASP carve-outs create potential pathways for asset transfers outside the secured perimeter — though the ICA’s Distressed Disposal provisions and covenant restrictions would constrain this.</p>

</table><p>Odeon is the <strong>smallest EBITDA contributor</strong> but trades <strong>above par</strong> — a paradox explained by the 12.75% coupon, structural seniority within the Odeon ring-fence, and approaching call-at-par date.</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-182-the-amc-odeon-linkage-problem"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-number">18.2</span><span class="section-title">The AMC-Odeon Linkage Problem</span></div><div class="research-text"><p>The single most critical issue for Odeon noteholders: <strong>AMC bankruptcy = automatic Odeon Event of Default</strong> (Section 6.01(e)/(f)). This means:</p><ol>
<li>AMC’s US restructuring directly threatens Odeon’s stability even if European operations are healthy</li>
<li>Upon acceleration, the call premium becomes due (currently ~$12.8M; drops to zero after Nov 2026)</li>
<li>Holders can rescind acceleration if majority agrees, but this requires coordinated action</li>
<li>The guarantee release on Change of Control means a sale of Odeon by AMC would simultaneously trigger the put right AND eliminate the AMC backstop</li>

- AMC calls Odeon Notes at par (after Nov 2026) or 103.188% (before)
- Noteholders receive full par + any applicable premium
- Strong incentive for AMC given the 12.75% coupon ($51M/year cash interest)</p><p><strong>Scenario B: AMC Files Ch.11 Before Nov 2026</strong>
- Automatic acceleration at Odeon
- Premium of ~103.188% becomes due
- European ring-fence may protect Odeon operations but legal linkage creates uncertainty
- Majority Holders can rescind acceleration if Odeon itself is performing</p><p><strong>Scenario C: AMC Files Ch.11 After Nov 2026</strong>
- Automatic acceleration at par (no premium)
- Same ring-fence / rescission dynamics
- More favorable for the company, less for Holders</p><p><strong>Scenario D: AMC Sells Odeon</strong>
- Change of Control triggered → 101% put right
- 90% drag-along means near-certain tender
- AMC guarantee simultaneously released
- Buyers may seek to refinance at lower coupon</p><p><strong>Scenario E: Distressed Exchange / LME at Odeon Level</strong>
- Given above-par trading and approaching maturity, less likely
- Amendment requires only 50%+1 for covenant waivers
- Sacred rights protect economic terms
- 66 2/3% needed to release collateral</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-184-defensive-playbook-for-odeon-noteholders"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-number">18.4</span><span class="section-title">Defensive Playbook for Odeon Noteholders</span></div><div class="research-text"><ol>
<li><strong>Accumulate 33 1/3%+ position</strong> — blocks collateral release / lien subordination</li>
<li><strong>Monitor AMC bankruptcy risk</strong> — the automatic cross-default is the primary threat</li>
<li><strong>Watch Parent Expenses</strong> — uncapped management fees/advisory costs could leak value upstream to AMC</li>
<li><strong>Track affiliate transactions below $6M/3% EBITDA</strong> — no arm’s-length requirement, no approval needed</li>
<li><strong>Coordinate with other Holders</strong> — form cooperation agreement to control Instructing Group threshold</li>
<li><strong>Consider rescission strategy</strong> — if AMC files Ch.11, majority Holders can rescind Odeon acceleration to preserve European ring-fence value</li>
<li><strong>Monitor call economics</strong> — after Nov 2026, AMC can call at par; the 12.75% coupon makes refinancing highly attractive</li>

<li><strong>What is the exact Instructing Group threshold in the ICA?</strong> The ICA exhibit controls who directs the Security Agent — this determines enforcement power</li>
<li><strong>Is there any Senior Facilities Agreement (bank debt) at Odeon level?</strong> If so, it ranks pari passu with the Notes and dilutes recovery</li>
<li><strong>What is the actual perfected collateral value?</strong> The ASPs create significant gaps — particularly Swedish security (acknowledged as NOT perfected) and German share pledges (pledgor always retains voting rights)</li>
<li><strong>What would a UK administration look like for Odeon?</strong> The ICA’s Enforcement Principles require a Competitive Process — how does this interact with UK insolvency procedures?</li>
<li><strong>Can AMC “Permitted Reorganization” exclude Odeon from automatic acceleration?</strong> The carve-out for Permitted Reorganizations in Event of Default (f) may create a pathway</li>
<li><strong>What is the interplay between the Odeon ICA and the AMC-level ICAs?</strong> AMC’s consolidated restructuring involves multiple intercreditor agreements — do they interact?</li>
