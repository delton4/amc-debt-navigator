It occurred in two stages:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Creation of the Structure (2016-2017)</strong>
1. J.Crew identified that its intellectual property (trademarks, brand names) was enormously valuable – the Madewell brand alone was estimated at $1B+.
2. The existing credit agreement had a basket permitting transfers of assets to “unrestricted subsidiaries” – entities outside the restricted group and therefore outside the collateral package securing the term loan.
3. J.Crew transferred its valuable IP assets (primarily the J.Crew and Madewell trademarks) to a newly created unrestricted subsidiary called “IPCo.”
4. This was done through a series of intermediate transfers, exploiting the “investment capacity” baskets that permitted the borrower to make investments in unrestricted subsidiaries up to certain thresholds.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Raising New Capital Against the Dropped-Down IP (2017-2018)</strong>
5. IPCo – now holding the crown-jewel IP outside the reach of existing creditors – was used to raise new secured debt, with the IP serving as collateral.
6. The proceeds were used to retire some existing unsecured debt at a discount, effectively stripping collateral value from secured lenders and benefiting the equity sponsors.</p><p><strong>Key Provisions Exploited:</strong>
- Unrestricted subsidiary designation provisions
- Investment baskets (General and “Available Amount” baskets permitted asset transfers to unrestricted subs)
- Lack of “J.Crew blocker” language preventing the transfer of material IP</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-key-players"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-title">Key Players</span></div><div class="research-text"><table class="research-table">

<li><strong>The birth of the “J.Crew blocker.”</strong> After this transaction, nearly every sophisticated credit agreement was amended to include provisions restricting the transfer of material IP or “crown jewel” assets to unrestricted subsidiaries. Lenders must always insist on J.Crew blocker language.</li>
<li><strong>Unrestricted subsidiary definitions matter enormously.</strong> Lenders must scrutinize the conditions under which subsidiaries can be designated as unrestricted and the investment baskets that permit asset transfers.</li>
<li><strong>Sponsors will exploit every contractual gap.</strong> TPG and Leonard Green used a creative reading of the credit agreement to strip value.</li>

<p><strong>Formation of the Majority Lender Group (mid-2020):</strong> Advent assembled a group of first lien and second lien lenders holding a bare majority (&gt;50%) of the first lien term loan.

<p><strong>The “Open Market Purchase” Theory:</strong> The credit agreement required unanimous consent to subordinate existing debt.

<p><strong>The Uptier Mechanics:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>The company issued approximately $200M in new super-priority first-out term loans with superior priority to existing first lien debt.</li>

<li><strong>Sacred rights must explicitly protect against priming.</strong> Traditional protections (rate, maturity, principal) do NOT protect against subordination via new priority debt. Lenders must insist that priming debt requires unanimous or affected lender consent.</li>
<li><strong>“Open market purchase” provisions must be narrowly defined.</strong> Post-Serta, agreements increasingly define this very narrowly. Many now include “Serta blockers.”</li>
<li><strong>Majority rules can be weaponized.</strong> A bare majority can fundamentally alter the priority waterfall. Key provisions should require supermajority (66.7%) or unanimous consent.</li>
<li><strong>Being in the minority is extremely dangerous.</strong> Lenders who cannot join the majority face severe adverse selection risk.</li>
<li><strong>Even winning in court may not fully protect you.</strong> Excluded lenders won but still suffered significant losses.</li>

A structure allowing a creditor to recover twice against the same collateral pool – once through a direct secured claim and once through an intercompany claim or guarantee. The favored creditor “dips” into the recovery pool twice.</p><p><strong>Step-by-Step:</strong></p><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Creation of New Subsidiary Structure:</strong> A new subsidiary (NewCo) was created and certain assets/operations contributed to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New Priority Financing at NewCo:</strong> NewCo raised new secured debt backed by contributed assets. Participating lenders provided this financing and/or exchanged existing debt into the NewCo structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Double-Dip Mechanic:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>New debt at NewCo was secured by contributed assets (first dip).</li>
<li>NewCo made an intercompany loan back to the parent, and participating lenders had a claim against the parent through this intercompany loan (second dip).</li>
<li>
<p>Result: Participating lenders could recover from BOTH NewCo assets AND claim against remaining parent-level collateral.</p>

<p><strong>Cooperation agreements among lenders.</strong> Lenders now enter agreements at facility inception, pre-committing to collective action and restricting individual participation in non-pro-rata exchanges.</p>
