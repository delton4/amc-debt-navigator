<p>In-court restructuring becomes necessary when out-of-court liability management exercises (LMEs) — uptier exchanges, dropdown transactions, covenant strips, and negotiated exchanges — fail to achieve a sustainable capital structure. For AMC Entertainment, multiple financial indicators point toward the need for a comprehensive in-court solution if voluntary restructuring efforts stall.</p>

<p><strong>AMC's distress triggers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unsustainable leverage:</strong> Consolidated Total Leverage of 12.47x ($4,003.5M debt / $321M EBITDA) and Muvico-level leverage of 19.43x ($3,118.9M / $175.5M allocable EBITDA) are incompatible with long-term solvency</li>
<li><strong>Interest coverage crisis:</strong> Consolidated interest coverage of 0.83x means AMC generates insufficient EBITDA to cover its approximately $267M annual cash interest burden, requiring drawdowns from the $417M cash reserve</li>
<li><strong>Maturity wall:</strong> $400M Odeon notes mature November 2027, the $1,999.1M Term Loan and $857M Muvico 15% PIK Notes mature February 2029, and the remaining tranches mature in 2029-2030 — a compressed timeline that requires restructuring action well in advance</li>
<li><strong>Cross-default cascade risk:</strong> A default on any Material Indebtedness exceeding $50M (DOC 4) or $150M (DOC 2) triggers cross-defaults across the entire capital structure, potentially forcing an involuntary or emergency filing</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity runway:</strong> At approximately $267M annual cash interest against $321M EBITDA, AMC's $417M cash balance provides roughly 18-24 months of deficit funding — placing the outer boundary of its runway around mid-to-late 2027 absent restructuring</li>
</ul>

<p>The Bankruptcy Code provides four primary in-court pathways: prepackaged Chapter 11, free-fall Chapter 11 with DIP financing, Section 363 asset sales (including credit bids), and Chapter 7 liquidation. Each pathway offers different tradeoffs between speed, cost, creditor control, and value preservation. The optimal choice depends on the degree of creditor consensus achievable before filing and the company's liquidity position at the time restructuring becomes unavoidable.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="research-text">
<p>Chapter 11 reorganizations fall on a spectrum defined by the degree of pre-petition preparation and creditor consensus.</p>

<p><strong>Prepackaged ("prepack") Chapter 11:</strong> The debtor negotiates a Restructuring Support Agreement (RSA) with key creditor constituencies, prepares a plan and disclosure statement, and solicits votes on the plan <em>before</em> filing the bankruptcy petition. Under Section 1126(b), votes solicited pre-petition count toward plan confirmation if the disclosure statement contained "adequate information" as defined in Section 1125. The prepack is filed simultaneously with the petition, and confirmation typically occurs within 45-90 days. Management retains control as debtor-in-possession throughout. This is the fastest, cheapest, and least disruptive path — professional fees are typically $20-50M versus $50-150M+ for free-fall cases. For AMC, a prepack requires consensus among at least the DOC 4 Term Loan holders (Required Lender majority of $1,999.1M) and ideally the DOC 2 PIK Note holders ($857M).</p>

<p><strong>Pre-arranged Chapter 11:</strong> The debtor files with a plan term sheet or RSA in hand but has not completed pre-petition solicitation. Votes are solicited post-petition under Section 1125, adding 2-4 months to the in-court timeline (typically 4-8 months total). The pre-arranged approach is used when full pre-petition solicitation is impractical — for instance, if one or more creditor classes require additional negotiation, or if the disclosure statement requires SEC review. Management retains debtor-in-possession status.</p>

<p><strong>Free-fall Chapter 11:</strong> The debtor files without any pre-negotiated plan, typically triggered by a liquidity crisis, cross-default cascade, or collapse of out-of-court negotiations. The debtor has a 120-day exclusivity period (extendable to 18 months under Section 1121) to file a plan. If exclusivity expires, any party in interest may file competing plans. DIP financing is essential to fund operations during the extended timeline (12-24 months). The US Trustee appoints an Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (UCC). Free-fall cases are the most expensive, most disruptive, and carry the greatest risk of value destruction — particularly for operationally intensive businesses like theatre chains where customer and content supplier confidence is critical.</p>

<p><strong>Trustee vs. debtor-in-possession:</strong> In prepack and pre-arranged cases, management retains control as debtor-in-possession under Sections 1107-1108. In free-fall cases, Section 1104 allows the court to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee for "cause" (fraud, dishonesty, incompetence, or gross mismanagement) or if appointment is in the "interests of creditors." Trustee appointment strips management of all authority and is particularly damaging for complex operating businesses like AMC, where institutional knowledge and content partner relationships are critical to preserving enterprise value.</p>

<!-- ═══ SECTION 3: CHAPTER 7 LIQUIDATION ══════════════════════════════════ -->

      <span class="section-title">Trustee Appointment, Asset Liquidation, and Absolute Priority</span>
    </div>
    <div class="research-text">
<p>Chapter 7 liquidation is governed by Sections 701-784 of the Bankruptcy Code and represents the terminal restructuring outcome. It occurs either through a direct Chapter 7 filing or, more commonly, through conversion from Chapter 11 under Section 1112(b) when the court determines that reorganization is not feasible.</p>

<p><strong>Trustee appointment:</strong> Upon conversion or filing, the US Trustee appoints an independent Chapter 7 trustee under Section 701. The trustee is a fiduciary whose sole duty is to marshal estate assets, liquidate them for maximum value, and distribute proceeds to creditors. Management is removed from all decision-making. For AMC, the loss of management control would immediately disrupt operations at 600+ theatre locations, as landlords, content suppliers, employees, and vendors react to the cessation of the going concern.</p>

<p><strong>Lease rejection and its impact:</strong> The Chapter 7 trustee would reject AMC's approximately 600 domestic theatre leases under Section 365. Each rejected lease creates an unsecured claim for the landlord capped under Section 502(b)(6) at the greater of one year's rent or 15% of the remaining lease term (maximum three years). With AMC's estimated annual lease obligations of $400-800M, these rejection claims could total $400M-$2.4B — massively diluting the unsecured creditor recovery pool.</p>

<p><strong>Asset liquidation:</strong> Theatre assets in liquidation recover a fraction of their operating value. Furniture, fixtures, and equipment (FF&E) — seating, projection systems, concession equipment — typically recover 10-25% of replacement cost at forced auction. Intellectual property (the AMC brand, AMC Stubs program, proprietary technology) is severely impaired without ongoing operations. Owned real property (limited for lease-dependent AMC) recovers closer to market value. Industry data from comparable theatre chain liquidations suggests total recovery of 40-60% of going-concern enterprise value.</p>

<p><strong>Distribution under Section 726:</strong> Absolute priority governs all distributions: (1) administrative expenses (trustee fees at 3-5%, professional fees, wind-down costs); (2) priority claims (employee wages, taxes); (3) secured creditors to the extent of collateral value; (4) general unsecured creditors; (5) subordinated claims; (6) equity interests. At estimated liquidation values of $1.0-1.5B against $4B of face debt, Chapter 7 produces severe losses across all creditor classes — making it the baseline against which every other restructuring alternative is measured under the Section 1129(a)(7) "best interests" test.</p>

      <span class="section-title">Voting, Cramdown, and Confirmation Standards</span>
    </div>
    <div class="research-text">
<p>The plan of reorganization is the vehicle through which Chapter 11 restructures the debtor's obligations. The Bankruptcy Code imposes detailed requirements for plan classification, voting, and confirmation.</p>

<p><strong>Classification (Section 1122):</strong> Claims are grouped into classes based on their legal nature and priority. AMC's capital structure would likely produce 8-10 classes: (1) DIP claims / administrative claims; (2) DOC 4 Term Loan secured claims; (3) DOC 2 Muvico 15% PIK Note secured claims; (4) DOC 5 Exchangeable Note claims; (5) DOC 7 Toggle Note claims; (6) DOC 3 AMC 7.5% Senior Secured Note claims; (7) DOC 6 Odeon Note claims (if included); (8) DOC 1 Subordinated Note claims; (9) general unsecured claims; (10) equity interests. Classification disputes are common — junior creditors may argue for separate classification to improve their negotiating position, while senior creditors prefer broad classes to minimize the number of classes that can block confirmation.</p>

<p><strong>Voting (Section 1126):</strong> Each impaired class votes on the plan. A class accepts if holders of at least two-thirds in dollar amount <em>and</em> more than one-half in number of claims actually voting in that class vote in favor. Unimpaired classes are deemed to accept. Classes receiving nothing are deemed to reject. For AMC, the DOC 4 Term Loan class is the critical swing vote — if those holders negotiate the plan (as in a prepack), their acceptance is assured. The contested classes are typically the junior tranches (DOC 2, DOC 7) that receive less than full recovery.</p>

<p><strong>Cramdown (Section 1129(b)):</strong> If at least one impaired class accepts the plan but others reject, the proponent can request "cramdown" — confirmation over the objection of dissenting classes. Cramdown requires the plan be "fair and equitable" with respect to each dissenting class and "not unfairly discriminate" among classes of equal priority. For secured creditors, "fair and equitable" means: (a) retention of liens plus deferred cash payments equal to the allowed secured claim; (b) sale of property free and clear with liens attaching to proceeds; or (c) providing the "indubitable equivalent" of the secured claim. For unsecured creditors, it means either full payment or application of the absolute priority rule — no junior class (including equity) receives anything unless the senior dissenting class is paid in full.</p>

<p><strong>Confirmation tests (Section 1129(a)):</strong> The court must find: (1) the plan complies with Bankruptcy Code requirements; (2) the proponent acted in good faith; (3) each creditor receives at least as much as in Chapter 7 liquidation (the "best interests" test); (4) the plan is "feasible" — the reorganized company can meet its obligations without likely need for subsequent restructuring; (5) at least one impaired class accepted without counting insiders. The feasibility test is where enterprise valuation becomes central: the plan must demonstrate that the reorganized AMC can service its post-emergence debt at a sustainable leverage level (typically 3-5x for theatre operators).</p>

      <span class="section-title">Section 364, Priming Liens, and AMC-Specific Considerations</span>
    </div>
    <div class="research-text">
<p>DIP financing provides the liquidity that keeps a Chapter 11 debtor operating while the restructuring plan is negotiated. Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code creates a hierarchy of post-petition financing authority.</p>

<p><strong>Section 364 hierarchy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>364(a)/(b) — Ordinary course unsecured credit:</strong> The debtor may obtain unsecured credit in the ordinary course without court approval. Credit extended outside the ordinary course requires court authorization and receives administrative expense priority.</li>
<li><strong>364(c) — Super-priority administrative expense:</strong> If the debtor cannot obtain credit under (a)/(b), the court may authorize credit with: (1) super-priority administrative expense status (senior to all other administrative expenses); (2) liens on unencumbered estate property; or (3) junior liens on encumbered property.</li>
<li><strong>364(d) — Priming liens:</strong> The most contentious authority. If the debtor cannot obtain credit under (c), the court may authorize credit secured by liens senior to existing liens on estate property. The court must find that existing lienholders are "adequately protected" — typically demonstrated through equity cushion in the collateral, replacement liens, or periodic cash payments.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>AMC DIP sizing and structure:</strong> AMC's $417M cash balance provides initial post-petition liquidity, but operating a 600+ location theatre network requires substantial working capital. Estimated DIP need: $500-800M, consistent with comparable theatre chain filings (Cineworld secured $1.94B in its 2022 filing). The DIP would likely be structured as a 364(d) priming facility secured by first-priority liens on all Muvico assets, with super-priority administrative expense status under 364(c).</p>

<p><strong>DOC 4 Section 9.02(b)(x) — The Pro Rata DIP Provision:</strong> This critical provision in the Term Loan Credit Agreement requires that any DIP facility subordinating the Term Loan must offer each existing lender pro rata participation on the same terms. This provision, which requires unanimous lender consent to waive, prevents a controlling lender group from exclusively capturing DIP economics (origination fees, above-market interest rates, roll-up provisions) at the expense of minority Term Loan holders. The provision explicitly references Section 364, demonstrating that the credit agreement drafters anticipated bankruptcy scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>Roll-up provisions:</strong> DIP lenders frequently negotiate "roll-up" rights — provisions that convert a portion of their pre-petition claims into DIP claims upon closing. Roll-ups effectively improve the DIP lender's priority from secured creditor to super-priority administrative claimant. For AMC, Term Loan holders providing DIP financing could negotiate to roll up 25-50% of their pre-petition claims ($500M-$1B) into the DIP, dramatically improving their recovery position relative to non-DIP-providing creditors.</p>

<p><strong>DIP terms for theatre operators:</strong> Based on comparable filings, AMC DIP terms would likely include: SOFR + 800-1000bps interest, 2-3% origination fee, 2% commitment fee, case milestones (plan filing within 120 days, confirmation within 270 days), budgeting and reporting covenants, and rights to credit bid under Section 363(k) if the case converts to an asset sale.</p>

      <span class="section-title">Section 363 Sales, Stalking Horse Bids, and Credit Bidding Rights</span>
    </div>
    <div class="research-text">
<p>Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code provides two pathways for selling estate assets: sales in the ordinary course under 363(c) and sales outside the ordinary course under 363(b), which require court approval after notice and a hearing.</p>

<p><strong>Section 363(b) sale process:</strong> The debtor or trustee files a sale motion, identifies a stalking horse bidder who sets the floor price, establishes bid procedures (including overbid increments, typically $5-10M, and break-up fees of 2-4%), conducts a competitive auction if qualified competing bids are received, and obtains court approval. The sale is conducted "free and clear" of all liens, claims, encumbrances, and interests under Section 363(f) — providing the buyer with clean title. Existing liens attach to the sale proceeds.</p>

<p><strong>Credit bidding under Section 363(k):</strong> A secured creditor holding an allowed claim secured by a lien on the property being sold may "credit bid" — bidding the face amount of its secured claim in lieu of cash. The Supreme Court unanimously affirmed this right in <em>RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank</em> (2012), holding that a Chapter 11 plan selling encumbered assets free and clear of liens must permit the lienholder to credit bid. The court retains discretion to limit credit bidding "for cause" — for instance, if the secured claim amount is genuinely disputed, or if credit bidding would chill competitive bidding and reduce estate value.</p>

<p><strong>AMC credit bid dynamics:</strong> The DOC 4 Term Loan holders hold $1,999.1M in secured claims against the Muvico collateral — giving them the ability to credit bid up to $2B for the domestic theatre operations. Any competing cash bidder must exceed this amount, an extremely high bar for distressed theatre assets. The credit bid effectively allows Term Loan holders to acquire the operating theatre network at their purchase cost (many holders acquired at 76 cents on the dollar, implying an effective acquisition cost of approximately $1.5B), potentially capturing significant upside if the business's going-concern value exceeds the credit bid amount.</p>

<p><strong>Overbid protection:</strong> The stalking horse (credit bidder) typically negotiates a break-up fee ($40-80M at 2-4% of transaction value) and expense reimbursement, payable from the estate if a higher bid prevails. These protections compensate the stalking horse for the time and expense of negotiating the initial bid and provide a floor for estate value. For AMC, the break-up fee also serves as a deterrent to speculative competing bids — any challenger must exceed the credit bid plus the break-up fee to justify the incremental cost.</p>

    <div class="section-header">
      <span class="section-title">Enterprise Valuation, Gift Plans, and Substantive Consolidation</span>
    </div>
    <div class="research-text">
<p>Enterprise valuation is the most contested issue in any large Chapter 11 case because it determines where the "fulcrum security" falls — the class that is partially impaired and therefore controls the restructuring outcome. For AMC, valuation determines whether the DOC 4 Term Loan is paid in full (shifting value to junior classes) or is the fulcrum security itself (receiving reorganized equity).</p>

<p><strong>Valuation methodologies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discounted cash flow (DCF):</strong> Projects future free cash flows and discounts at the weighted average cost of capital. For AMC, the DCF analysis depends critically on assumptions about post-pandemic box office recovery, streaming competition, and AMC's ability to capture premium pricing through format upgrades. Creditor groups will present competing DCF analyses with widely divergent assumptions.</li>
<li><strong>Comparable company trading multiples:</strong> Applies EV/EBITDA multiples from comparable public theatre operators (Cinemark at approximately 7-9x, international peers at 5-7x). At $321M EBITDA and a 7-9x multiple, AMC's implied EV is $2.2-2.9B — enough to cover the Term Loan but leaving limited recovery for junior tranches.</li>
<li><strong>Comparable transaction multiples:</strong> Analyzes precedent theatre chain acquisitions and restructurings. Post-COVID theatre transactions suggest depressed multiples reflecting structural headwinds from streaming competition.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidation analysis:</strong> Establishes the floor value under Section 1129(a)(7). As detailed in the Chapter 7 section, AMC's estimated liquidation value is $1.0-1.5B.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Gift plans and intercreditor negotiations:</strong> When the fulcrum security class (likely DOC 4 Term Loan holders) controls the restructuring, it may offer a "gift" or "tip" to junior classes — distributing a portion of the reorganized equity to classes that would otherwise receive nothing under strict absolute priority. Gifts are used to avoid cramdown litigation, secure junior class votes (which simplifies confirmation), and resolve potential valuation disputes. For AMC, DOC 4 holders might offer 5-10% of reorganized equity as a gift to DOC 2 PIK Note holders, DOC 3 holders, and potentially DOC 1 subordinated holders.</p>

<p><strong>Substantive consolidation risk:</strong> The dual-entity structure (AMC holdco + Muvico LLC) creates a risk that unsecured creditors or the UCC will seek substantive consolidation — treating both entities as a single estate for distribution purposes. Consolidation would eliminate Muvico-level structural priority, meaning DOC 4 and DOC 2 holders would compete with AMC-level creditors against the combined asset pool. Courts apply a multi-factor test considering whether entities maintained separate books, commingled assets, observed corporate formalities, and whether creditors relied on the separate identity. Given that AMC and Muvico share management, offices, and treasury functions, consolidation arguments have some merit — though the arm's-length creation of Muvico in 2021 with independent documentation weighs against consolidation.</p>

      <span class="section-title">DIP Needs, Lease Rejection, Consolidation Risk, and Odeon</span>
    </div>
    <div class="research-text">
<p>AMC's capital structure and operational profile create specific challenges and opportunities in an in-court restructuring that distinguish it from generic Chapter 11 analysis.</p>

<p><strong>DIP financing needs:</strong> AMC's $417M cash balance provides an initial cushion, but post-petition operations at 600+ locations require substantial working capital. Estimated DIP need of $500-800M accounts for: ongoing theatre operations ($150-200M monthly operating costs), the cessation of pre-petition debt service (freeing approximately $22M/month in cash interest), potential cash collateral usage disputes, and a liquidity reserve for unexpected disruptions (studio holdbacks, vendor transitions). The DOC 4 pro rata DIP provision (Section 9.02(b)(x)) ensures all Term Loan holders can participate, but the DIP terms — particularly roll-up provisions and case milestones — will be heavily negotiated.</p>

<p><strong>Lease portfolio and Section 365:</strong> AMC's approximately 600 domestic theatre leases are its most significant executory contracts. In Chapter 11, the debtor must assume or reject each lease within 120 days (extendable to 210 days under Section 365(d)(4)). Assumed leases require cure of all monetary defaults (back rent, maintenance obligations), while rejected leases create capped unsecured claims. The lease portfolio analysis is the most operationally intensive aspect of any AMC bankruptcy: each location must be evaluated for profitability, lease terms (remaining term, renewal options, below/above-market rent), and strategic value. In comparable theatre bankruptcies, debtors typically reject 15-30% of locations — for AMC, this could mean closing 90-180 underperforming theatres. The resulting overhead reduction and EBITDA margin improvement are key to plan feasibility.</p>

<p><strong>Substantive consolidation risk (AMC/Muvico):</strong> The 2021 Muvico creation involved a dropdown of substantially all domestic theatre assets from AMC holdco to Muvico LLC. Unsecured creditors of AMC holdco (including DOC 1 Sub Note holders, $125.5M) have strong incentive to argue for substantive consolidation, which would give them access to the Muvico asset pool rather than being limited to the depleted AMC holdco estate. Key consolidation factors: (1) AMC and Muvico share management teams and office space; (2) AMC's consolidated financial reporting may not clearly segregate Muvico operations; (3) the 2021 dropdown was itself a liability management exercise, raising questions about whether the separation was genuinely arm's-length. Counter-arguments: Muvico has separate debt instruments, separate borrower designations, separate collateral packages, and was created through a documented transaction with independent financial advisor opinions.</p>

<p><strong>Odeon ring-fence in bankruptcy:</strong> The Odeon Finco PLC structure presents a unique cross-border issue. Odeon is incorporated in England, its assets are pledged exclusively to DOC 6 holders ($400M Senior Secured Notes), and it operates independently across the UK, Ireland, Spain, Italy, and Germany. If AMC files Chapter 11 in the US, Odeon would not automatically be included. The question is whether AMC would seek to include Odeon through a Chapter 15 recognition proceeding (which could allow coordination between US and UK proceedings) or leave Odeon outside the US case. DOC 6 holders would strongly resist inclusion, as the ring-fence preserves their direct claim on Odeon assets (European theatre network, approximately $15M EBITDA). Odeon's own leverage (26.67x) suggests it faces independent restructuring challenges regardless of the US proceeding.</p>

<p><strong>AMC Stubs loyalty program:</strong> The AMC Stubs program (30M+ members) represents a significant intangible asset that is preserved in a prepack or 363 sale but destroyed in a Chapter 7 liquidation. In Chapter 11, the program's value supports DIP financing (demonstrating ongoing customer revenue) and enhances the going-concern premium that justifies reorganization over liquidation. Any plan must address the treatment of existing reward obligations as administrative claims or customer deposits.</p>

<p><strong>Key observations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DOC 4 Term Loan holders recover most under a 363 credit bid</strong> (85-100%), where they acquire the assets directly, versus a prepack (65-85%) where they share value with junior classes through negotiation.</li>
<li><strong>DOC 2 PIK Note holders strongly prefer a prepack</strong> (35-55%) over any other in-court pathway, because a prepack preserves going-concern value and gives them negotiating leverage to extract meaningful equity in the reorganized entity. In a credit bid or liquidation, their 1.5L position recovers little or nothing after the $2B Term Loan is satisfied.</li>
<li><strong>DOC 6 Odeon holders are relatively insulated</strong> across all scenarios due to the structural ring-fence, with recovery primarily dependent on Odeon's standalone performance rather than AMC's US restructuring outcome.</li>
<li><strong>AMC-level instruments (DOC 3, DOC 1) face near-zero recovery</strong> in all in-court scenarios except a prepack where gifted equity or warrants may provide 0-15% recovery.</li>
<li><strong>Chapter 7 is universally the worst outcome</strong> for every tranche, confirming its role as the floor recovery baseline for all restructuring negotiations.</li>
