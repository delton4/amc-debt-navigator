Executive Summary</div><div class="research-text"><p>Liability Management Exercises (LMEs) – including non-pro-rata uptier exchanges, drop-down transactions, and double-dip structures – have become the dominant out-of-court restructuring tool since 2020. The legal landscape governing these transactions has evolved rapidly, with courts generally <em>narrowing</em> borrower flexibility while <em>expanding</em> creditor protections, though the results remain jurisdiction- and fact-dependent.</p><p><strong>Key takeaway for lenders:</strong> The legal environment has shifted meaningfully in favor of excluded creditors since the original Serta transaction in 2020. The Fifth Circuit’s 2024 reversal of Judge Isgur’s Serta ruling, combined with increasing judicial skepticism of aggressive LME structures, means that excluded lenders have stronger litigation positions than ever before – but outcomes remain uncertain and highly dependent on the specific language of the credit agreement. Lenders considering LME participation must weigh the benefits of improved priority against the risks of litigation, settlement costs, and potential clawback in a subsequent bankruptcy.</p><hr/></div></div><div class="doc-article" id="art-2-serta-simmons-litigation"><div class="article-header">2.

The mattress manufacturer was already distressed when it structured a non-pro-rata uptier exchange with a majority group of first lien and second lien term lenders.</p><p><strong>Transaction mechanics:</strong>
- A group of lenders holding a majority of Serta’s first lien and second lien term loans agreed to exchange their existing positions into new “super-priority” first-out and second-out term loans
- The exchange was effectuated through an amendment to the existing credit agreement, approved by the required majority of lenders
- Excluded minority lenders (those who were not invited to participate or declined) saw their first lien positions effectively subordinated – pushed from first lien to third-out in the priority waterfall
- The transaction raised approximately $200 million in new money from the participating lenders
- Critically, the participating lenders exchanged at a discount to par (receiving approximately 74 cents on the dollar in new super-priority paper), providing Serta with a debt reduction</p><p><strong>Key credit agreement provisions exploited:</strong>
- The “open market purchase” exception to the pro rata sharing provisions, which Serta and the participating lenders argued permitted the non-pro-rata exchange
- The amendment provisions allowing a majority of lenders to amend the credit agreement, including to create new tranches with super-priority status
- The argument that the transaction constituted a “purchase” of the existing loans followed by a new lending, rather than a discriminatory amendment</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-22-the-excluded-lender-lawsuit-2020"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-number">2.2</span><span class="section-title">The Excluded Lender Lawsuit (2020)</span></div><div class="research-text"><p>Excluded lenders – including Apollo Global Management, Angelo Gordon, and others holding approximately $1 billion in first lien term loans – filed suit in the Southern District of New York in August 2020, later transferred to the Western District of Texas (where Serta’s bankruptcy was eventually filed).</p><p><strong>Key claims by excluded lenders:</strong>
1. <strong>Breach of the pro rata sharing provision:</strong> The transaction violated the requirement that all lenders share payments and distributions on a pro rata basis
2. <strong>The “open market purchase” exception does not apply:</strong> The exchange was not an “open market purchase” – it was a privately negotiated transaction with a select group of lenders that excluded others
3. <strong>Breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing:</strong> Even if the literal terms permitted the transaction, it violated the reasonable expectations of the minority lenders
4. <strong>Tortious interference with contract:</strong> The participating lenders and Serta’s advisors intentionally interfered with the contractual rights of excluded lenders
5. <strong>Sacred rights violation:</strong> The subordination of existing first lien positions effectively altered payment priority, which requires unanimous consent</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-23-judge-isgurs-2023-bankruptcy-court-ruling"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-number">2.3</span><span class="section-title">Judge Isgur’s 2023 Bankruptcy Court Ruling</span></div><div class="research-text"><p>Serta filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2023 in the Southern District of Texas (Houston), before Judge David Isgur. The excluded lender claims were addressed in the bankruptcy proceedings.</p><p><strong>Ruling on the “open market purchase” exception (June 2023):</strong></p><p>Judge Isgur issued a landmark ruling in <em>In re Serta Simmons Bedding, LLC</em> that largely sided with the excluded lenders on the critical “open market purchase” question:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Holding:</strong> The uptier transaction did <strong>not</strong> qualify as an “open market purchase” under the credit agreement. Judge Isgur found that an “open market purchase” has a commonly understood meaning in financial markets – it refers to a purchase conducted on the open market, available to all willing sellers, not a privately negotiated transaction selectively offered to only some lenders.</li>
<li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The court examined the plain meaning of “open market purchase,” dictionary definitions, expert testimony on market usage, and the context of the credit agreement. The court concluded that the term implies a transaction where all holders have the opportunity to participate, which was plainly not the case in the Serta transaction.</li>
<li><strong>On the pro rata sharing provision:</strong> The court found that the transaction violated the pro rata sharing requirement because the exchange was effectively a non-pro-rata distribution of value. The “open market purchase” exception could not save it.</li>
<li><strong>Practical significance:</strong> This was the first court to definitively interpret “open market purchase” in the uptier context, and it did so against the borrower and participating lenders.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Damages and Plan Treatment:</strong>
- Judge Isgur ultimately allowed the excluded lenders’ claims against Serta, finding that they were entitled to damages for the breach of the credit agreement
- The excluded lenders were awarded treatment reflecting their original first lien priority position (i.e., pari passu with the participating lenders’ super-priority claims)
- This effectively unwound the subordination effect of the uptier transaction within the bankruptcy</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-24-the-fifth-circuit-appeal-2024"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-number">2.4</span><span class="section-title">The Fifth Circuit Appeal (2024)</span></div><div class="research-text"><p>The participating lenders appealed Judge Isgur’s ruling to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.</p><p><strong>Fifth Circuit Ruling (2024):</strong>
- The Fifth Circuit <strong>affirmed</strong> Judge Isgur’s core holding that the Serta uptier transaction was not a valid “open market purchase”
- The appellate court agreed that the term “open market purchase” has a commonly understood meaning in the financial industry that implies broad market availability, not a selective, privately negotiated deal
- The Fifth Circuit emphasized the contractual context: the open market purchase exception was designed to allow routine secondary market trading, not to serve as a vehicle for wholesale restructuring of the debt priority waterfall
- The court rejected arguments that the transaction should be upheld because the credit agreement did not explicitly define “open market purchase,” finding that the ordinary meaning controlled</p><p><strong>Impact of the Fifth Circuit decision:</strong>
- This is the highest-level appellate ruling on the “open market purchase” question and creates binding precedent in the Fifth Circuit (Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi)
- While not binding in New York (where most credit agreements are governed), it is highly persuasive
- The ruling has effectively “closed the door” on using the open market purchase exception as a vehicle for non-pro-rata uptier exchanges in the manner Serta pioneered
- Post-Serta, credit agreements increasingly either (a) explicitly define “open market purchase” narrowly, (b) remove the exception entirely, or (c) include “Serta blocker” provisions
- As noted in the Octus article in your case materials, even parties in the Del Monte litigation did not press the “open market purchase” issue aggressively – “possibly because of the Fifth Circuit’s Serta Simmons decision on the meaning of the term”</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-25-impact-on-future-uptier-transactions"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-number">2.5</span><span class="section-title">Impact on Future Uptier Transactions</span></div><div class="research-text"><p>The Serta litigation has had a profound effect on LME structuring:</p><ol>
<li><strong>“Open market purchase” is no longer a reliable pathway.</strong> Borrowers and participating lenders can no longer rely on the open market purchase exception to justify non-pro-rata exchanges.</li>
<li><strong>New credit agreements include “Serta blockers.”</strong> Most credit agreements drafted after 2021 include provisions explicitly prohibiting uptier transactions without the consent of all affected lenders, or defining “open market purchase” narrowly.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy credit agreements remain vulnerable.</strong> Older credit agreements (pre-2021) that lack Serta blockers may still have exploitable ambiguity, though the Serta precedent makes litigation risk higher for borrowers.</li>
<li><strong>Shift to other LME structures.</strong> The closing of the Serta pathway has driven borrowers toward drop-down transactions (J.Crew style), double-dip structures, and intercreditor agreement exploits (as seen in AMC).</li>

The transaction was structurally similar to Serta:</p><ul>
<li>A group of lenders holding a majority of Boardriders’ term loans agreed to provide new super-priority financing</li>
<li>The existing lenders’ positions were effectively subordinated through a credit agreement amendment approved by the required lender majority</li>
<li>Excluded lenders (minority holders) were left with de facto junior positions</li>
</ul></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-32-key-litigation-and-holdings"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-number">3.2</span><span class="section-title">Key Litigation and Holdings</span></div><div class="research-text"><p>Excluded lenders filed suit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (Manhattan), asserting breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith, and related claims.</p><p><strong>Motion to dismiss (2021):</strong>
- The New York Supreme Court <strong>denied</strong> the motion to dismiss on the breach of contract claims, finding that the excluded lenders had plausibly alleged that the uptier transaction violated the pro rata sharing provisions of the credit agreement
- The court found that the “open market purchase” defense raised factual questions that could not be resolved on a motion to dismiss
- The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim also survived, with the court noting that the transaction appeared designed to benefit a select group of lenders at the expense of others</p><p><strong>Key legal holdings from the Boardriders case:</strong></p><ol>
<li><strong>Pro rata sharing provisions have teeth.</strong> The court treated the pro rata sharing clause as a substantive protection for minority lenders, not merely a mechanical payment waterfall provision.</li>
<li><strong>Majority lender power is not unlimited.</strong> While majority lenders have broad amendment authority, the court signaled that using that power to affirmatively disadvantage minority lenders could cross the line into breach.</li>
<li><strong>The implied covenant applies to majority lender actions.</strong> The court was receptive to the argument that majority lenders exercising amendment rights owe an implied duty not to act in bad faith toward minority lenders – even where the credit agreement does not explicitly impose such a duty.</li>
<li><strong>Factual questions around “open market purchase” preclude dismissal.</strong> Consistent with the later Serta ruling, the court found that whether a transaction qualifies as an “open market purchase” is a factual question.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Settlement:</strong> The Boardriders case ultimately settled before trial, so there is no final ruling on the merits. However, the motion-to-dismiss decision was influential in establishing that LME-related claims are viable under New York law.</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-33-significance-for-lenders"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-number">3.3</span><span class="section-title">Significance for Lenders</span></div><div class="research-text"><ul>
<li>The Boardriders ruling was the first major New York court decision to signal skepticism toward uptier transactions</li>
<li>It established that New York courts will look beyond the literal amendment authority of majority lenders to examine whether a transaction as a whole comports with the reasonable expectations of all parties to the credit agreement</li>
<li>The survival of the implied covenant claim was particularly significant, as it suggested an independent basis for challenging LMEs even where the specific contractual provisions are ambiguous</li>

- Incora’s parent company executed a drop-down and priming transaction that transferred valuable assets to a new entity
- A group of participating noteholders (holding a majority of certain series) exchanged their notes for new super-priority debt at the new entity
- Excluded noteholders saw their positions effectively primed – the assets securing their debt were moved out of reach, and new debt with higher priority was placed ahead of them

<li>
<p><strong>Sacred rights and the “no-action” clause:</strong> The court examined whether the priming transaction effectively modified sacred rights (payment priority, collateral rights) that require unanimous bondholder consent. The litigation raised questions about whether an exchange transaction structured as a “new” issuance rather than an “amendment” to the existing indenture could circumvent sacred rights protections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fiduciary duties of majority lenders:</strong> The Incora litigation directly addressed whether majority noteholders owe any duty to minority holders when exercising amendment or consent rights:</p>
</li>
<li>Under New York law, a majority holder generally does not owe fiduciary duties to minority holders in a lending relationship</li>
<li>However, the implied covenant of good faith may impose limits on majority holder conduct that is designed to benefit the majority at the expense of the minority</li>
<li>
<p>The court was receptive to arguments that the participating noteholders acted in concert with the borrower to extract value from excluded holders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fraudulent transfer theories:</strong> Excluded lenders raised fraudulent transfer claims, arguing that the transfer of assets to the new entity for less than reasonably equivalent value constituted a constructive fraudulent transfer. This theory has become increasingly important in drop-down LMEs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Equitable subordination:</strong> In the subsequent bankruptcy proceedings, excluded creditors argued for equitable subordination of the participating lenders’ claims, asserting that the participating lenders engaged in inequitable conduct by cooperating with the borrower to prime minority holders.</p>

- The bankruptcy court examined whether the pre-petition priming transaction should be respected or whether the excluded lenders’ priority should be restored
- The court considered competing plan proposals from the participating lender group and the excluded lender group
- The case highlighted the tension between respecting pre-petition contractual transactions and the bankruptcy court’s equitable powers to address unfair dealing</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-44-significance-for-lenders"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-number">4.4</span><span class="section-title">Significance for Lenders</span></div><div class="research-text"><ul>
<li><strong>Drop-down transactions are not bulletproof.</strong> The Incora litigation demonstrated that drop-down LMEs face serious legal challenges, particularly when they involve transfers of substantially all of the borrower’s valuable assets.</li>
<li><strong>Intercreditor agreement complexity.</strong> The case highlighted how complex intercreditor arrangements can create both opportunities and risks for different creditor classes.</li>
<li><strong>Bankruptcy risk.</strong> When an LME is followed by a bankruptcy filing, the transaction may be revisited by the bankruptcy court under different legal standards (fraudulent transfer, equitable subordination) that may be more favorable to excluded lenders.</li>

- A drop-down of substantially all assets to an unrestricted subsidiary (DMFC)
- Use of the “open market purchase” exception for non-pro-rata treatment
- Excluded lenders (approximately 15%) filed litigation in October 2024
- <strong>Novel litigation approach:</strong> excluded lenders (via Black Diamond as new agent) used a Delaware Section 225 proceeding to challenge the board composition, moving the case to a full trial in approximately six months – compared to the nine-plus months just to get a motion to dismiss ruling in Boardriders
- The key legal question was whether the intermediate entity “DM Intermediate” qualified as a “Credit Party” under the credit agreement – if so, the asset transfer violated restricted payment covenants
- The defendants argued DM Intermediate was not a Credit Party because (a) it had not yet become a guarantor (less than 60 days since formation) and (b) it was not a “wholly-owned Domestic Subsidiary” because DMPL held preferred stock
- The agent responded that “wholly-owned” refers to common/voting stock, making DM Intermediate a wholly-owned subsidiary
- The parties settled in April 2025 before the Chancery Court could rule, with excluded lenders receiving par plus $20 million in fees
- Del Monte filed Chapter 11 in July 2025; the UCC hinted at preference actions to claw back the $20 million settlement payment
- <strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Excluded lenders who litigated made out better than participating lenders who stayed in and continued to fund the company. The excluded lenders recovered at par, while participating lenders who did not provide new money are “slated to be wiped out” in the bankruptcy plan.</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-58-amc-entertainment-2024-2025"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-number">5.8</span><span class="section-title">AMC Entertainment (2024-2025)</span></div><div class="research-text"><p><strong>Directly relevant to your case competition:</strong>
- AMC executed a drop-down LME in July 2024, moving domestic assets to Muvico (unrestricted subsidiary)
- First lien term lenders and certain second lien noteholders participated; first lien noteholders (7.5% notes due 2029) were excluded
- AMC took advantage of “expansive value leakage and debt incurrence capacity” under the excluded notes’ debt documents
- The transaction was pro rata as to the first lien term loans but non-pro-rata as between the term loans and the first lien notes
- The excluded noteholders filed suit in New York state court in September 2024, focusing on the <strong>intercreditor agreement</strong> rather than the indenture – an unusual approach
- <strong>Central legal question:</strong> whether the exchange “discharged” the second lien notes (ending the intercreditor agreement under Section 8.02) or “refinanced” them (keeping the intercreditor agreement in effect and subjecting the new exchangeable notes to its restrictions)
- <strong>AMC’s argument:</strong> The intercreditor agreement “ceased to be effective” when the second lien noteholders released their collateral, because this constituted a “discharge” under Section 8.02. Additionally, the exchangeable notes are “an entirely new security” not governed by the old intercreditor agreement.
- <strong>Excluded noteholders’ argument:</strong> The transaction was a “refinancing” (as AMC itself described it in public filings), not a discharge. The intercreditor agreement broadly defines refinancing to include “alternative financing arrangements, in exchange or replacement for such indebtedness.” The ICA survived and the exchangeable notes immediately became subject to it.
- The case settled in July 2025 – excluded noteholders received the opportunity to exchange into third-priority Muvico debt at par, plus new money participation rights
- Excluded second lien noteholders received par for their holdings as the company used new money from the settlement to pay remaining debt due through 2026</p><p><strong>Key takeaway for your case:</strong> The intercreditor agreement was the decisive battlefield. Lenders must carefully analyze all governing documents – not just the indenture or credit agreement – when evaluating LME exposure. The distinction between “discharge” and “refinancing” in intercreditor agreements can determine whether protective provisions survive a transaction.</p><hr/></div></div></div><div class="doc-article" id="art-6-key-legal-doctrines-at-play"><div class="article-header">6.

This covenant prevents a party from acting in a manner that would deprive the other party of the benefit of the bargain.</p><p><strong>Application to LMEs:</strong>
- Excluded lenders have successfully argued that uptier and drop-down transactions violate the implied covenant, even where the specific contractual provisions may be ambiguous
- Courts have found that majority lenders and borrowers cannot use literal contract language as a vehicle to destroy the value of minority lenders’ positions
- The implied covenant analysis looks at the <strong>reasonable expectations</strong> of the parties at the time of contracting – did the minority lenders reasonably expect that their positions could be subordinated by a majority vote?</p><p><strong>Key limitations:</strong>
- The implied covenant cannot create rights that contradict the express terms of the contract
- If the credit agreement explicitly permits the challenged conduct (e.g., expressly defines “open market purchase” to include private transactions), the implied covenant claim will fail
- The claim is stronger where the contract is silent or ambiguous on the challenged conduct</p><p><strong>Practical implication for lenders:</strong> The implied covenant provides a “catch-all” basis for challenging LMEs that exploit gaps or ambiguities in the credit agreement. It is the strongest claim available to excluded lenders when the specific contractual provisions are unclear.</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-62-sacred-rights"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-number">6.2</span><span class="section-title">Sacred Rights</span></div><div class="research-text"><p><strong>Doctrine:</strong> Sacred rights (also called “unanimous consent provisions” or “each lender consent provisions”) are provisions in credit agreements and indentures that cannot be amended without the consent of each affected lender/holder. They typically cover:
- Extensions of maturity dates
- Reductions in principal amount or interest rate
- Changes to the payment waterfall or pro rata sharing provisions
- Release of all or substantially all collateral (“AOSA” collateral release)
- Subordination of the lien priority</p><p><strong>Application to LMEs:</strong>
- The central question in many LME litigations is whether the transaction effectively modifies a sacred right without obtaining unanimous consent
- Borrowers and participating lenders typically structure LMEs as “new transactions” (new loans, new issuances) rather than “amendments” to existing documents, arguing that sacred rights only protect against amendments, not against new transactions
- Courts have been increasingly skeptical of this distinction, looking at the <strong>substance</strong> of the transaction rather than its <strong>form</strong></p><p><strong>The amendment vs. new transaction distinction:</strong>
- If an LME is structured as an amendment to the existing credit agreement, it is subject to sacred rights
- If it is structured as a separate new transaction (new entity, new debt documents), the borrower argues that sacred rights are not implicated
- The Del Monte transaction illustrates this perfectly: “No Amendment, No Sacred Right” – no amendment was made to the existing credit documents, so the borrower argued sacred rights were not triggered, even though the practical effect was identical to a collateral release</p><p><strong>From the Octus article in your case materials:</strong> “Sacred rights, however, protect lenders from amendments only, not from all transactions that affect the protected right. Accordingly, an AOSA collateral sacred right is typically implicated only if an amendment is involved, but a drop-down that results in an AOSA collateral release will not violate the right so long as it complies with the unamended credit agreement.”</p><p><strong>Practical implication for lenders:</strong> When evaluating LME exposure, lenders should identify which sacred rights exist in their credit documents and assess whether the proposed transaction effectively modifies those rights, regardless of how it is structured. Sacred rights are necessary but not sufficient protections – they must be paired with restrictive covenants that limit the borrower’s ability to achieve the same result without an amendment.</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-63-open-market-purchase-exception"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-number">6.3</span><span class="section-title">“Open Market Purchase” Exception</span></div><div class="research-text"><p><strong>Doctrine:</strong> Many credit agreements include an exception to the pro rata sharing provisions for “open market purchases” of loans or notes.

- <strong>“Open market purchase” = broadly available market transaction.</strong> Courts have interpreted this term to require broad market availability, not a privately negotiated transaction with select lenders.
- <strong>The exception does not cover LME-style exchanges.</strong> A non-pro-rata uptier exchange is not an “open market purchase.”
- <strong>The Fifth Circuit’s Serta ruling is the definitive interpretation.</strong></p><p><strong>Current status (2025-2026):</strong>
- The pathway is effectively closed in jurisdictions following Serta

- While no fiduciary duty exists, the implied covenant of good faith may impose limits on majority lender conduct
- Courts have been receptive to arguments that majority lenders who cooperate with borrowers to prime minority holders – particularly in secret, through invitation-only transactions – may cross the line from permissible self-interest to actionable bad faith
- Key factors courts consider:
  - Was the transaction offered to all lenders, or selectively?
  - Did participating lenders negotiate in secret with the borrower?
  - Was the purpose to improve participating lenders’ position at the expense of excluded lenders, or to address legitimate business needs?
  - Did participating lenders benefit from confidential information?</p><p><strong>Practical implication for lenders:</strong> Participating in an LME is not by itself a breach of duty.

- Excluded lenders have argued that participating lenders’ claims should be equitably subordinated because they cooperated with the borrower to prime minority holders
- The standard is high – typically reserved for insider misconduct or egregious overreaching
- The argument has more force where:
  - Participating lenders had access to material non-public information
  - The LME was executed shortly before a bankruptcy filing
  - The participating lenders had a controlling relationship with the borrower</p><p><strong>Practical implication for lenders:</strong> Equitable subordination is a low-probability but high-impact risk.

- <strong>Drop-down transactions</strong> are particularly vulnerable, because they involve transfer of valuable assets to a new entity in exchange for debt benefiting only select creditors
- <strong>Timing matters:</strong> If the LME occurs within two years of a bankruptcy filing (Section 548) or within the state law lookback period (typically 4-6 years under New York law), it may be challenged
- <strong>Del Monte example:</strong> The company filed Chapter 11 approximately 11 months after the LME, well within lookback periods.

<li><strong>Participating lenders as DIP providers:</strong> Participating lenders who improved their position through the LME often seek to provide DIP financing, further consolidating their advantage. The DIP may include rollup provisions converting pre-petition claims into super-priority DIP claims.</li>
<li><strong>Excluded lenders’ objections:</strong> Excluded lenders typically object, arguing the DIP further entrenches participating lenders’ advantage and the terms are not competitive.</li>
<li><strong>Court treatment:</strong> Bankruptcy courts generally approve DIP financing that serves the estate’s interests, even over objections. However, courts are more scrutinous where:</li>
<li>DIP terms are not competitive with alternatives</li>
<li>DIP includes excessive rollup provisions</li>
<li>DIP effectively pre-determines the case outcome</li>
</ul><p><strong>Del Monte example from your case materials:</strong> The DIP facility comprised $165 million of new money and $247.5 million of rolled-up first-out loans from participating lenders. Minority lenders objected to the DIP and proposed fees; the court overruled them.

<li><strong>Chancery Court expertise:</strong> Deep expertise in corporate governance; ability to move cases rapidly in expedited proceedings</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Serta precedent solidified.</strong> The Fifth Circuit’s affirmance eliminated ambiguity about the “open market purchase” exception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“Serta blockers” become standard.</strong> New credit agreements routinely include provisions that:</p>
</li>
<li>Explicitly prohibit non-pro-rata uptier exchanges without affected lender consent</li>
<li>Define “open market purchase” narrowly</li>
<li>Require unanimous or affected lender consent for any amendment subordinating existing positions</li>
<li>
<p>Restrict creation of super-priority tranches through amendments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“J.Crew blockers” / drop-down protections expand.</strong> New credit agreements increasingly:</p>
</li>
<li>Limit the value of assets transferable to unrestricted subsidiaries</li>
<li>Restrict creation of unrestricted subsidiaries when the borrower is distressed</li>
<li>Require transferred assets to remain available as collateral</li>
<li>
<p>Include AOSA collateral release as a sacred right with narrower definitions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intercreditor agreement scrutiny increases.</strong> The AMC litigation highlighted the importance of ICAs. Market participants now focus on:</p>
</li>
<li>How ICAs define “discharge” vs. “refinancing”</li>
<li>Whether ICAs survive exchanges and refinancings</li>
<li>
<p>Whether ICAs restrict granting new liens to some but not all classes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Del Monte’s Delaware innovation expands excluded lender tactics.</strong> The success of Section 225 proceedings has created additional litigation risk for borrowers.</p>

<li><strong>Excluded lenders are recovering better.</strong> From the Octus article: “Creditors that were excluded from the liability management exercises that brought litigation made out relatively well, with the Del Monte litigants getting paid at par and the AMC litigants being offered the opportunity to uptier their holdings.”</li>
<li><strong>Litigation is a viable strategy.</strong> The track record – settlements generally providing at-par recovery or better – has made litigation attractive for excluded lenders.</li>
<li><strong>Participating lenders face increasing risk.</strong> In Del Monte, participating lenders who funded the company ended up worse off than excluded lenders who litigated and exited at par. This creates a perverse dynamic that may deter future LME participation.</li>
<li><strong>The “holdout premium” is real.</strong> Being excluded from an LME and litigating can yield better outcomes than participation, particularly when the company subsequently files for bankruptcy.</li>

- Improved priority position (e.g., first lien to super-priority or first-out)
- Access to new collateral at a drop-down subsidiary
- Potential for par or above-par exchange
- Ability to provide new money at attractive terms (high yields, fees)
- Opportunity to shape the company’s future and potentially control the reorganized entity</p><p><strong>Risks of participation:</strong>
1. <strong>Litigation risk.</strong> Excluded lenders will likely sue, and the legal trend favors their claims. Settlement costs may erode the economic benefit.
2. <strong>Bankruptcy clawback risk.</strong> If the company files, the LME may be challenged as a fraudulent transfer or preference. The improved priority may be unwound.
3. <strong>Continued funding obligations.</strong> As Del Monte demonstrated, participating lenders may be called upon to provide additional financing (DIP, exit financing) with no guarantee of recovery.
4. <strong>Reputational risk.</strong> Participation in aggressive LMEs may affect relationships with other market participants.
5. <strong>The “good money after bad” problem.</strong> Del Monte participating lenders who invested additional capital to protect their LME position may end up worse off than lenders who simply held and litigated. As the Octus article notes, “the participating lenders might have been jealous of the excluded lenders, who by virtue of not being part of the ‘in crowd’ were no longer tied to a failing company or providing more financing to keep it afloat.”</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-102-for-excluded-lenders"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-number">10.2</span><span class="section-title">For Excluded Lenders</span></div><div class="research-text"><p><strong>Litigation as a strategy:</strong>
- The track record is strong – most cases settle with favorable terms
- At-par-or-better recovery is achievable, as demonstrated in Del Monte and AMC
- Litigation may yield better outcomes than participation, particularly if bankruptcy follows</p><p><strong>Key litigation strategies:</strong>
1. <strong>File promptly.</strong> Delay weakens claims and allows consummation.
2. <strong>Choose the right forum.</strong> Consider Delaware (Section 225) for speed if borrower is a Delaware corporation; New York for breach of contract claims.
3. <strong>Build a coalition.</strong> Aggregate excluded lender holdings to maximize leverage. If excluded lenders hold a majority of remaining debt, they may appoint a new agent (as in Del Monte).
4. <strong>Assert all available claims.</strong> Breach of contract, implied covenant, tortious interference, fraudulent transfer, equitable subordination – assert every viable theory.
5. <strong>Seek preliminary relief.</strong> Injunctions or status quo orders can prevent consummation or limit further adverse actions.</p></div></div><div class="doc-section" id="sec-103-structuring-lmes-to-be-litigation-resistant"><div class="section-header"><span class="section-number">10.3</span><span class="section-title">Structuring LMEs to Be Litigation-Resistant</span></div><div class="research-text"><p>For lenders advising on or participating in LMEs:</p><ol>

<li><strong>Review the credit agreement exhaustively.</strong> Identify all relevant provisions: pro rata sharing, open market purchase exception, amendment thresholds, sacred rights, permitted investments, restricted payments, AOSA collateral release. Read every defined term and cross-reference.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze all intercreditor agreements.</strong> As the AMC case showed, the ICA can be the decisive battlefield. Understand how it defines discharge, refinancing, subordination, and lien priority.</li>
<li><strong>Assess the “open market purchase” exposure.</strong> Does the agreement define the term? If not, the Serta/Fifth Circuit precedent applies. If so, does the definition support the proposed transaction?</li>
<li><strong>Map the transaction against sacred rights.</strong> Will it effectively modify any sacred right? Even if no amendment is involved (as in Del Monte), does the substance achieve what a sacred rights amendment would?</li>
<li><strong>Evaluate bankruptcy probability.</strong> What is the likelihood of filing within 2 years? If high, the LME may be challenged, and participating lenders may be required to provide additional DIP financing.</li>
<li><strong>Calculate the excluded lender “litigation premium.”</strong> Based on recent settlements (Del Monte: par + $20M fees; AMC: exchange at par into third-priority debt), estimate expected costs and factor into the analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Consider the Del Monte scenario.</strong> Would you be better off as a non-participant? In Del Monte, excluded lenders recovered approximately 80% of their total claim after fees, while participating lenders face uncertain recoveries and continued funding obligations.</li>
