It deletes seven sections from the Indenture -- every single protective covenant that limited what AMC could do with bondholder money. Each deleted section and what it used to protect: Section 4.05 -- Limitation on Consolidated Indebtedness: Previously capped how much total debt AMC could take on. Without this, AMC can borrow unlimited amounts senior to these notes. Section 4.06 -- Limitation on Restricted Payments: Previously blocked AMC from paying dividends, buying back stock, or transferring value to equity holders while debt was outstanding. Without this, cash can flow to shareholders ahead of bondholders. Section 4.07 -- Limitation on Liens: Previously restricted AMC's ability to pledge assets as collateral for other debt. Without this, AMC can encumber all assets with senior liens, pushing these bondholders further back in line. Section 4.08 -- Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates: Previously prevented self-dealing -- AMC couldn't transfer assets to related parties at below-market prices. Without this, value can be moved away from bondholders. Section 4.09 -- Limitation on Senior Subordinated Indebtedness: Previously restricted AMC from issuing more debt at the same level. Without this, these notes can be diluted by unlimited new same-priority debt. Section 4.10 -- Future Guarantors: Previously required new subsidiaries to guarantee these notes. Without this, AMC can park assets in new subsidiaries beyond bondholders' reach. Section 4.11 -- Change of Control: Previously required AMC to offer to repurchase the notes at 101% if there was a change of control. Without this, the company can be sold without giving bondholders an exit. All seven sections are replaced with \"[Intentionally Omitted]\" -- legal language confirming they were deliberately erased, not accidentally forgotten. (a) The Indenture is hereby amended by deleting the following Sections of the Indenture and all references and definitions related solely thereto in their entirety: · Section 4.05 (Limitation on Consolidated Indebtedness); · Section 4.06 (Limitation on Restricted Payments); · Section 4.07 (Limitation on Liens); · Section 4.08 (Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates); · Section 4.09 (Limitation on Senior Subordinated Indebtedness); · Section 4.10 (Future Guarantors); · Section 4.11 (Change of Control); and All such deleted Sections are replaced with \"[Intentionally Omitted].\""

    "content": "The original merger covenant (Section 5.01) had multiple conditions AMC had to meet before merging or consolidating with another entity. The revised version strips it down to only two requirements : Obligation Assumption: If AMC merges into another entity, that entity must formally assume AMC's obligations under the notes (so there's still someone on the hook for the debt). Officer's Certificate + Opinion of Counsel: AMC just needs to deliver a signed certificate from an officer and a lawyer's letter saying the merger complies. This is a self-certification -- essentially AMC vouching for itself. What was removed: The original Section 5.01 likely required that after the merger, the surviving entity had to meet financial tests (e.g., no more leveraged than before), pass a \"no default\" test, and maintain certain coverage ratios. Those substantive protections are gone. Now AMC can merge with anything, as long as the new entity formally assumes the debt and AMC's own officer signs off. (b) Section 5.01 of the Indenture (Consolidation) is hereby amended and restated in its entirety by the following: \"Section 5.01. Consolidation. The Company shall not, in a single transaction or through a series of related transactions, consolidate with or merge with or into any other Person unless: (a) (i) either the Company shall be the continuing corporation or (ii) the Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged shall expressly assume, by an indenture supplemental hereto, executed and delivered to the Trustee all of the Obligations of the Company under the Securities and the Indenture; and (b) the Company has delivered, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation or merger, and such supplemental indenture in respect thereto comply with the provisions described herein and that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to such transaction have been complied with.\""

The old AMC is released from all obligations under the notes. Combined with the weakened merger covenant in Section 5.01, this means AMC can effectively transfer itself into a new entity and walk away from the debt -- as long as the new entity signs the assumption agreement. There are no financial health requirements for the successor. (c) Section 5.02 of the Indenture (Successor Substituted) is hereby amended and restated in its entirety, for purposes of making changes conforming to the amendments to Section 5.01, by the following: \"Section 5.02. Successor Substituted. Upon any consolidation or merger, the successor corporation formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged, shall succeed to, shall be substituted for and may exercise every right and power of the Company under the Securities and this Indenture, with the same effect as if such successor corporation had been named as the Company herein.

Automatic release clause: If a Guarantor is sold or merged with any entity that is NOT AMC or an AMC subsidiary, that Guarantor's guarantee automatically terminates . This makes it trivially easy to release subsidiary guarantees through corporate transactions -- sell the subsidiary, and the guarantee vanishes.

But the actual covenant changes (Article I) only kick in when the Exchange Offer is consummated -- meaning when the new 10%/12% PIK Toggle notes are actually issued and the old notes surrendered. This protects AMC: if the exchange fell through, the covenant strip wouldn't take effect. But once the exchange closed, the strip became permanent and irrevocable. AMC was required to notify the Trustee when the exchange was completed (or if it was abandoned). AMC also represents and certifies to the Trustee that the majority consent threshold was met. This is another self-certification -- the Trustee relies on AMC's word rather than independently counting votes. Section 2.9 EFFECTIVENESS. The provisions of this Second Supplemental Indenture shall be effective upon execution and delivery of this instrument by the parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the amendments set forth in Article I of this Second Supplemental Indenture shall become operative only upon the consummation of the Exchange Offer. The Company shall notify the Trustee promptly after the Exchange Offer is consummated or after the Company shall determine that the Exchange Offer will not be consummated. The Company, by providing notice to the Trustee of the consummation of the Exchange Offer, hereby represents, warrants, and certifies to the Trustee that the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities outstanding have provided consents to the execution of this Second Supplemental Indenture."

The exchanging holders got new 10%/12% Second Lien Secured Notes with actual collateral. The holdouts were left with a covenant-free, guarantee-free unsecured instrument against a company in severe financial distress during COVID-19. This is the textbook \"exit consent\" playbook."

Why it matters: Authentication by the Trustee is the gatekeeper that ensures only properly authorized notes enter circulation, including any PIK Notes that increase outstanding principal. One Officer shall sign the Notes for the Company by manual, electronic or facsimile signature. If the Officer whose signature is on a Note no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note, the Note shall be valid nevertheless. At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver (i) Additional Notes and (ii) PIK Notes executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a written order of the Company in the form of an Officer’s Certificate for the authentication and delivery of such Additional Notes or PIK Notes, as applicable, and the Trustee in accordance with such written order of the Company shall authenticate and deliver such Notes. A Note shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the Note. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Note has been authenticated under this Indenture. The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to authenticate the Notes. Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Notes whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as any Registrar, Paying Agent or agent for service of notices and demands. The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Notes if the issue thereof will adversely affect the Trustee’s own rights, duties, indemnities or immunities under the Notes and this Indenture."

CSC Delaware Trust Company serves as both initially. The Company can change these agents without prior notice to holders. Why it matters: The Paying Agent holds funds in trust for noteholders, so its proper functioning is essential for timely interest and principal payments. The Company shall maintain an office or agency where Notes may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (the “Registrar”) and an office or agency where Notes may be presented for payment (the “Paying Agent”). The Registrar shall keep a register of the Notes and of their transfer and exchange. The Company may have one or more registrars for so long as the Notes are held in registered form, and one or more co-registrars. The initial Paying Agent will be CSC Delaware Trust Company, in New York. The initial Registrar and transfer agent for the Notes will be CSC Delaware Trust Company in New York. The Registrars and the transfer agents will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Notes in the form of Definitive Notes (as defined in Exhibit A) outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive Notes on behalf of the Company. Each transfer agent shall perform the functions of a transfer agent. The Company may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders of the Notes. The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Registrar, Paying Agent or transfer agent not a party to this Indenture. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such agent. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the name and address of any such agent. If the Company fails to maintain a Registrar, Paying Agent or transfer agent, the Trustee shall act as such and shall be entitled to appropriate compensation therefor pursuant to Section 7.07. AMC or any of its domestic Wholly Owned Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent in respect of the Notes."

    "content": "Paying Agent To Hold Money and PIK Notes in Trust. By 11:00 AM New York time on any payment date, the Company must deposit sufficient funds with the Paying Agent. For PIK interest, the Company must deliver written direction to increase the Global Note principal or issue PIK Notes in certificated form. The Paying Agent holds these amounts in trust for holders. Why it matters: This is the operational mechanism for PIK interest -- rather than paying cash, the Company increases the principal amount of the outstanding notes, compounding the debt. By no later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date on which any principal of or interest on any Note is due, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent for such Note a sum sufficient to pay such principal and interest so becoming due and/or, if the Company is entitled or required, as the case may be, to pay PIK interest with respect to an interest payment period as provided for in Section 2.14, increase the principal amount of the Notes to pay any PIK interest pursuant to a written direction delivered to the Trustee specifying the increase in the Global Note, or in the limited circumstances where the Notes are no longer held in global form, issue PIK Notes to pay any PIK interest pursuant to an Authentication Order with respect to the PIK interest to be issued on the applicable interest payment date, when so becoming due. The Company shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that such Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or the Trustee all money held by such Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or interest on the Notes and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Company or any Guarantor in making any such payment. If the Company or a domestic Wholly Owned Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed by such Paying Agent. Upon complying with this Section 2.05, the Paying Agent (if other than the Company or a domestic Wholly Owned Subsidiary) shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee."

The Company may elect to pay the Additional Rate portion as PIK interest by delivering a PIK Election notice at least 15 days before the payment date. If no timely PIK Election is made, the Additional Rate is paid in cash. PIK interest is paid by increasing the Global Note principal amount or issuing certificated PIK Notes. Why it matters: This is the central mechanism of the leverage-based interest grid. At current ~19.4x Muvico leverage (Level 1), the Company pays 9% cash and 6% PIK, meaning the principal amount grows by 6% annually without any cash outflow. This compounding effect significantly increases the total debt burden over time.

Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, the date of issuance of such Notes (including Additional Notes). (b) If the Additional Rate is payable and the Company elects to pay it in PIK interest for an interest payment period, the Company shall deliver a written notice to the Trustee and the Holders prior to the fifteenth (15th) calendar day immediately prior to the interest payment date for such interest payment period, which notice shall state the form of interest payment with respect to such interest period and the total amount of interest to be paid on such interest payment date (a “PIK Election”). If a PIK Election is made in accordance with the previous sentence, such PIK interest shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.14(c). In the event that the Company does not make a timely PIK Election in accordance with this clause (b) for an interest payment period, then the Company shall be deemed to have elected to pay the Additional Rate, if applicable, in cash.

There are extensive carve-outs for: refinancing existing debt, capital leases, intercompany loans, and permitted incremental facilities. Why it matters: With current leverage at ~19.4x, Muvico is deeply restricted from incurring new debt outside the carved-out baskets. Any new financing would need to fit within specific exceptions rather than the general incurrence test. (a) AMC will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, incur any Indebtedness or issue any shares of Disqualified Equity Interests and AMC will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock other than (i) to AMC or an AMC Group Guarantor, (ii) if such Subsidiary is a member of the Muvico Group, to Muvico or a Muvico Group Guarantor, or (iii) if such Subsidiary is a member of the Odeon Group, to another member of the Odeon Group.

The general basket requires the Company to satisfy a Coverage Ratio test and caps cumulative restricted payments at a builder basket that grows with 50% of cumulative Consolidated Net Income. Why it matters: This is a critical protection for noteholders - it prevents the company from bleeding cash out to shareholders while creditors remain at risk. Given AMC's distressed leverage, this covenant is likely already binding. (a) AMC will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, pay or make, directly or indirectly: (i) any dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, securities or other property) with respect to any Equity Interests in AMC or any Subsidiary, (ii) any payment (whether in cash, securities or other property), including any sinking fund or similar deposit, on account of the purchase, redemption, retirement, acquisition, cancellation or termination of any Equity Interests in AMC or any Subsidiary or any option, warrant or other right to acquire any such Equity Interests; or (iii) any Restricted Investment; (such payments or any other actions described in clauses (i) through (iii) above are collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”).

(b) Any Lien created for the benefit of Holders of the Notes pursuant to this Section 4.07 shall provide by its terms that such Lien be deemed automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien. In addition, in the event that an Initial Lien is or becomes a Permitted Lien, the Company may, at its option and without consent from any Holder, elect to release and discharge any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the preceding paragraph in respect of such Initial Lien."

(a) AMC will cause each of its Subsidiaries, which is the primary obligor or that guarantees Obligations from time to time under: (i) the Term Loan Credit Agreement, (ii) the Exchangeable Notes, (iii) the New Exchangeable Notes, or (iv) any other indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company or any Guarantor in an aggregate principal amount in excess of $150,000,000 (any Indebtedness in the foregoing (i)-(iv), “Guarantee Reference Indebtedness”), to, and (b) upon (x) the formation or acquisition of any new Subsidiary (in each case, other than an Excluded Subsidiary) by AMC or its Subsidiaries or (y) any Excluded Subsidiary ceasing to constitute an Excluded Subsidiary, AMC or the Company will cause such Subsidiary to, in each case, execute and deliver (i) a supplemental indenture to this Indenture, providing for a Guarantee by such Person, (ii) a joinder to the Security Agreement, and any other applicable Security Document, as a grantor, pledger or like term thereunder, and (iii) joinders to any applicable Intercreditor Agreement or new intercreditor agreements and security documents, together with any filings and agreements to the extent necessary under law or otherwise required by the Security Documents to create or perfect the security interests for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral of such Subsidiary, within 30 days of the date of (x) such Subsidiary’s obligation in respect of, or guarantee of, such other Indebtedness, or (y) such formation, acquisition or cessation, as applicable, pursuant to which such Person will unconditionally guarantee, on a joint and several basis, the full and prompt payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Notes, in each case in accordance with Article XI; provided that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing clause (a) above, entry into any such guarantee, joinder or Security Document pursuant to clause (a) shall not be required to the extent such Subsidiary does not guarantee Guarantee Reference Indebtedness of the kind referred to in clauses (a)(i)-(iv) above."

AMC must file with the SEC and provide to the Trustee and holders the same annual and quarterly reports required under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Additionally, the Company must furnish Rule 144A information to prospective investors and, within 15 business days of each interest period, provide the current Applicable Rate and Additional Rate with supporting public data. Why it matters: The obligation to disclose the current interest rate grid level is unique to this PIK instrument and allows holders to track whether the leverage-based rate is shifting between levels. (a) AMC shall file with the SEC and provide the Trustee and Holders of Notes, with such annual and quarterly reports and such information, documents and other reports as are specified in Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act and applicable to a U.S. corporation subject to such Sections, such information, documents and reports to be so filed and provided at the times specified for the filing of such information, documents and reports under such Sections; provided, however, that AMC shall be deemed to have provided such information, documents and other reports to the extent publicly filed or furnished with the SEC and shall not be so obligated to file such information, documents and reports with the SEC if the SEC does not permit such filings but AMC shall still be obligated to provide such information, documents and reports to the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes in such event. (b) In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Company shall furnish to prospective investors, upon their request, (i) any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Securities Act and (ii) within 15 Business Days of the beginning of each interest period, the then current Applicable Rate and if applicable, the Additional Rate, and the public information required to determine the Applicable Rate and, if applicable, the Additional Rate. (c) [Reserved]. (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the obligations in this Section 4.12 may be satisfied by a parent of AMC; provided that to the extent such information relates to a parent of AMC, such information is accompanied by consolidating information, which may be unaudited, that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such parent, on the one hand, and the information relating to AMC and its Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, on the other hand, and to the extent such information is in lieu of information required to be provided under this Section 4.12, such materials are accompanied by a report and opinion of an independent registered public accounting firm of nationally recognized standing, which report and opinion shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and (b) other than to the extent required pursuant..."

The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, not later than five days after any delivery of quarterly (or annual) financial statements under Section 4.12, a certificate of a Financial Officer (i) certifying as to whether a Default has occurred and, if a Default has occurred, specifying the details thereof and any action taken or proposed to be taken with respect thereto, (ii) setting forth the Total Leverage Ratio as of the most recently ended Test Period and (iii) with respect to financial statements for the first and third fiscal quarters delivered pursuant to Section 4.12, setting forth the Applicable Rate for the next upcoming interest period. When a Default has occurred and is continuing or if the Trustee, any Holder or the trustee for or the holder of any other evidence of Indebtedness of AMC or any Subsidiary gives any notice or takes any other action with respect to a claimed Default, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate specifying such Default, notice or other action within 10 Business Days of its occurrence."

If Net Proceeds exceed a threshold and are not applied, Muvico must make an Excess Proceeds Offer to repurchase notes at par.

    "content": "Acceleration; Rescission and Annulment. Upon an Event of Default (other than bankruptcy), holders of at least 30% in principal amount or the Trustee may declare all Notes immediately due. Bankruptcy Events of Default trigger automatic acceleration. A majority of holders can rescind acceleration if the Company cures the defaults and pays overdue amounts. Critically, upon acceleration, the Company must pay the Applicable Premium as if the notes were optionally redeemed, creating a make-whole-like penalty. Why it matters: The Applicable Premium on acceleration is unusual and creates a significant additional cost for the Company in a default scenario, effectively treating acceleration as an early redemption event. (a) If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(e) or (f)) occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee, by notice to the Company, or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding, by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, all the Notes to be due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(e) or (f) occurs and is continuing, then the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, all the Notes shall automatically become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. The Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Notes if in the reasonable judgment of the Trustee, acceleration is not in the interest of the Holders. (b) At any time after a declaration of acceleration has been made, but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as provided hereinafter in this Article VI, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if: (i) the Company has paid or deposited, or caused to be paid or deposited, with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay: (A) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; (B) all overdue interest on all Notes; (C) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Notes that has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate borne by the Notes; and (D) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate borne by the Notes; and (ii) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of principal of the Notes which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 6.04.

Holders of a majority in principal amount may waive existing defaults and their consequences, except for defaults in payment of principal or interest, or defaults relating to provisions that require unanimous consent to amend. Why it matters: This allows the majority to give the Company a second chance after non-payment defaults, but protects every individual holder's right to receive payments when due. Subject to Section 6.02, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding voting together as a single class by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default and its consequences under this Indenture and the Security Documents, except (a) a Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on a Note held by a non-consenting Holder or (b) a Default in respect of a provision that under Section 9.02 cannot be amended without the consent of each Holder affected. When a Default is waived, it is deemed cured, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right."

However, the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or, subject to Section 7.01, that the Trustee or Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders or would involve the Trustee or Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable in personal liability. Prior to taking any action hereunder, the Trustee and/or Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to reasonable indemnification, in its sole discretion, against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action."

Outside of defaults, it performs only duties expressly stated in the indenture. The Trustee is not liable for good faith errors in judgment and may rely on certificates and opinions without independent investigation. Why it matters: The heightened duty of care during defaults means the Trustee becomes more active when it matters most, but its limited pre-default obligations mean holders should not expect proactive monitoring. (a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent Person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such Person’s own affairs. (b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default: (i) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and (ii) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, and will be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein). (c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own grossly negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that: (i) this clause (c) does not limit the effect of clause (b) of this Section 7.01; (ii) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Trust Officer unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and (iii) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.05. (d) Every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to clauses (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 7.01.

(f) Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.

The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document.

(b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officer’s Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on the Officer’s Certificate or Opinion of Counsel. (c) The Trustee may act through agents and shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed with due care.

The Company must pay the Trustee's compensation (not limited by trust law), reimburse all documented expenses, and indemnify against losses incurred in administering the trust (except for willful misconduct or gross negligence).

The Company shall indemnify the Trustee (acting in any capacity hereunder) against any and all loss, liability or expense (including documented attorneys’ fees) incurred by it in connection with the acceptance and administration of this trust and the performance of its duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not reimburse any expenses or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee’s own willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith. The Company need not pay for any settlement made by the Trustee without the Company’s consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. All rights, protections, indemnifications and releases from liability granted hereunder to the Trustee shall extend to it acting in any capacity hereunder and its officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns. To secure the Company’s payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Notes on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee other than money or property held in trust to pay principal of and interest on particular Notes. The Company’s indemnification and payment obligations pursuant to this Section shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and the discharge of this Indenture.

    "content": "Replacement of Trustee. The Trustee may resign by notifying the Company. A majority of holders may remove the Trustee. The Company must remove the Trustee if it fails eligibility requirements, becomes insolvent, or is otherwise incapable of acting. If no successor is appointed within 30 days, the Company appoints one; failing that, any holder who has held for 6+ months may petition a court. Why it matters: The ability to remove and replace the Trustee gives holders recourse if the Trustee becomes unresponsive or conflicted. The Trustee may resign at any time by so notifying the Company. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and may appoint a successor Trustee by so notifying the resigning Trustee of its replacement. The Company shall remove the Trustee if: (a) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10; (b) the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent; (c) a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or (d) the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting. If the Trustee resigns, is removed by the Company or by the Holders a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and such Holders do not reasonably promptly (but in any event, within 30 days following such resignation or removal) appoint a successor Trustee, or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason (the Trustee in such event being referred to herein as the retiring Trustee), the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07. If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee or the Holders of 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee. If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Note for at least six months may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee. Notwithstanding the replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section, the Company’s obligations under Section 7.07 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee."

The indenture is discharged when all notes are canceled or the Company deposits sufficient cash/Government Securities to pay all amounts due. The Company has two defeasance options: (1) legal defeasance, which releases all obligations and releases collateral liens, or (2) covenant defeasance, which releases obligations under Sections 4.03-4.10, 4.12, 4.13, 4.15-4.17, 4.19, and parts of Section 5.01. Certain obligations (Sections 2.03-2.09, 4.01, 7.07, 7.08, and 8.03-8.06) survive until notes are paid in full. Why it matters: Legal defeasance effectively makes the notes risk-free by substituting government securities for the Company's credit, while covenant defeasance gives the Company freedom from restrictions while keeping the notes outstanding. (a) When (i) either (A) all outstanding Notes that have been authenticated (other than Notes replaced pursuant to Section 2.07 and Notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the Company) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or (B) all Notes under this Indenture that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable, whether at the Maturity Date or upon redemption or will become due and payable within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption pursuant to Article III and the Company irrevocably deposits or causes to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in amounts as will be sufficient without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium and accrued interest to the Maturity Date or redemption date; (ii) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or shall occur as a result of such deposit and such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other instrument to which the Company or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Company or any Guarantor is bound; (iii) the Company or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under this Indenture and the Notes; and (iv) the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under this Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes issued thereunder at the Maturity Date or the redemption date, as the case may be, then upon demand of the Company (accompanied by an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, at the cost and expense of the Company, to the Trustee stating that all conditions precedent specified herein relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with)..."

Why it matters: The IRS ruling requirement for legal defeasance is a very high bar, making it nearly impossible unless tax law changes specifically permit it. The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option only if: (a) The Company shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee satisfying the requirements of Section 7.10 who shall agree to comply with the provisions of this Article VIII applicable to it) as trust funds in trust for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay and discharge and which shall be applied by the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee) to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the outstanding Notes on the Maturity Date (or redemption date, if applicable) of such principal (and premium, if any) or installment of interest; provided that the Trustee shall have been irrevocably instructed to apply such money or the proceeds of such Government Securities to said payments with respect to the Notes. Before such a deposit, the Company may give the Trustee, in accordance with Section 3.01 hereof, a notice of its election to redeem all of the outstanding Notes at a future date in accordance with Article III; (b) in the case of the legal defeasance option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (i) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (ii) since the date of this Indenture there has been a change in the applicable U.S. Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be subject to U.S. Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred; (c) in the case of the covenant defeasance option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as a result of..."

The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to give their consent or take any other action described above or required or permitted to be taken pursuant to this Indenture. Such record date shall be a date not more than 30 days prior to the first solicitation of Holders generally in connection therewith and no later than the date such solicitation is completed. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to give such consent or to revoke any consent previously given or to take any such action, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 180 days after such record date. For all purposes of this Indenture, all Initial Notes and Additional Notes shall vote together as one series of Notes under this Indenture."

If an amendment changes the terms of a Note, the Trustee may require the Holder of the Note to deliver such Note to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Note regarding the changed terms and return such Note to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Note shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Note that reflects the changed terms.

    "content": "Guarantee. Each Guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, jointly and severally, all payment obligations under the Notes (including post-petition interest in bankruptcy). The guarantee is a guarantee of payment, not collection -- holders need not pursue the Company first. The guarantee survives extensions, renewals, and modifications of the obligations. Why it matters: Joint and several liability means any single Guarantor can be held responsible for the entire outstanding amount. The inclusion of post-petition interest is significant because it strengthens the noteholders' claim in bankruptcy beyond what unsecured creditors receive. Subject to the provisions of this Article XI, each Guarantor hereby fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, jointly and severally with each other Guarantor, to each Holder of the Notes and the Trustee, the full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, of the principal of, premium, if any (including the Applicable Premium), and interest on the Notes and all other obligations and liabilities of the Company under this Indenture and the Notes (including, without limitation, any interest, fees or expenses accruing subsequent to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, whether or not such interest, fees or expenses is an allowed claim under applicable state, federal or foreign law and the obligations under Section 7.07) (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the “Guarantor Obligations”). Each Guarantor agrees that the Guarantor Obligations will rank equally in right of payment with other indebtedness of such Guarantor, except to the extent such other Indebtedness is subordinate to the Guarantor Obligations. Each Guarantor further agrees (to the extent permitted by law) that the Guarantor Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound under this Article XI notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guarantor Obligation. Each Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of payment from and protest to the Company of any of the Guarantor Obligations and also waives notice of protest for non-payment. Each Guarantor waives notice of any default under the Notes or the Guarantor Obligations. Each Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (and not a guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder to any security held for payment of the Guarantor Obligations. Except as set forth in Section 11.02, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than payment of the Guarantor Obligations in full), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall..."

The guarantee remains effective regardless of whether it is endorsed on the physical notes.

Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that its Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Guarantee. If an Officer of a Guarantor whose signature is on this Indenture no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note or at any time thereafter, such Guarantor’s Guarantee of such Note shall nevertheless be valid.

No Guarantor may be released if it holds material intellectual property. Why it matters: The fraudulent conveyance savings clause protects the guarantee from being voided but may reduce the guaranteed amount.

    "content": "Notes Collateral Agent. The Notes Collateral Agent is appointed as agent for all holders, with purely ministerial and administrative duties -- no fiduciary or implied obligations. The CSC Delaware Trust Company initially serves as both Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent. The Agent may resign with notice; if no successor is appointed within 30 days, it may petition a court. The Agent may seek holder direction before acting and is not liable for acting on majority holder instructions. Critically, the Agent defers to the Controlling Collateral Agent (1L) and Designated Senior Representative on Muvico Group collateral matters. Why it matters: The deferral to senior lien holders' agents on collateral decisions means these 1.5L noteholders have limited independent control over their collateral, making the Intercreditor Agreement terms paramount to their actual recovery. (a) The Company and each of the Holders by acceptance of the Notes hereby designates and appoints the Notes Collateral Agent as its agent under this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements, and the Company and each of the Holders by acceptance of the Notes hereby irrevocably authorizes the Notes Collateral Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Notes Collateral Agent by the terms of this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements, and consents and agrees to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreements and each Security Document, as the same may be in effect or may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with their respective terms. The Notes Collateral Agent agrees to act as such on the express conditions contained in this Section 12.08. Each Holder agrees that any action taken by the Notes Collateral Agent in accordance with the provision of this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents, and the exercise by the Notes Collateral Agent of any rights or remedies set forth herein and therein shall be authorized and binding upon all Holders. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements, the duties of the Notes Collateral Agent shall be ministerial and administrative in nature, and the Notes Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, including any duty to monitor, perfect, maintain or enforce any security interest, except those expressly set forth herein and in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements to which the Notes Collateral Agent is a party, nor shall the Notes Collateral Agent have or be deemed to have any trust or other fiduciary relationship with the Trustee, any Holder or any Grantor, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties,..."

The Company or the Trustee by notice to the other may designate additional or different addresses for subsequent notices or communications. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice.

Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to the Holder at the Holder’s address as it appears on the registration books of the Registrar and shall be sufficiently given if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. All notices, approvals, consents, requests and any communications under this Indenture must be in writing (provided that any communication sent to the Trustee must be in the form of a document that is signed manually or by way of a digital signature provided by DocuSign (or such other digital signature provider as specified in writing to the Trustee by the Company)), in English. The party providing electronic instructions agrees to assume all risks arising out of the use of digital signatures and electronic methods to submit communications to the Trustee, including without limitation the risk of the Trustee acting on unauthorized instructions, and the risk of interception and misuse by third parties; provided, however, that the Trustee’s conduct does not constitute willful misconduct, negligence or bad faith."

In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified Person, it is not necessary that all such matters be certified by, or covered by, the opinion of, only one such Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents. Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Company may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate or opinion is based are erroneous. Any such certificate or Opinion of Counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an officer or officers of the Company stating that the information with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the Company, unless such counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous.

They limit new debt, restrict dividends and payments to equity holders, cap liens on assets, and control transactions with affiliates. For this instrument, the leverage-based interest rate grid is critical: the higher the Total Leverage Ratio, the more interest shifts from cash to PIK, growing the debt pile. The interest rate structure is: Base rate: 7.50% cash, plus incremental amounts based on leverage: Level 1 (>= 7.50x leverage): +1.50% cash, +6.00% PIK = 15% total ; Level 2 (6.50-7.50x): +2.375% cash, +2.375% PIK = 12.25% total ; Level 3 (< 6.50x): +4.00% cash only = 11.50% total . At current ~19.4x Muvico leverage, these notes are firmly in Level 1, paying 9% cash + 6% PIK."

Satisfaction and discharge occurs when all notes are paid or delivered for cancellation. Legal defeasance releases the Company from all obligations by depositing sufficient cash or Government Securities with the Trustee to pay all future amounts due. Covenant defeasance releases only from certain covenants while keeping the notes outstanding. Why it matters: Defeasance is extremely unlikely for a distressed issuer like Muvico because it requires depositing enough risk-free assets to pay all future principal and interest -- something only well-capitalized issuers can afford."

The Company may make payment of any defaulted interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.

(a) The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, pay or make, directly or indirectly: (i) any dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, securities or other property) with respect to any Equity Interests in the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, (ii) any payment (whether in cash, securities or other property), including any sinking fund or similar deposit, on account of the purchase, redemption, retirement, acquisition, cancellation or termination of any Equity Interests in the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or any option, warrant or other right to acquire any such Equity Interests; or (iii) any Restricted Investment; (such payments or any other actions described in clauses (i) through (iii) above are collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”) unless at the time of and after giving effect to the proposed Restricted Payment: (A) in the case of a Restricted Payment under any of clauses (i) and (ii) above (other than with respect to amounts attributable to subclause (1) of clause (C) below), no Event of Default described under Section 6.01 shall have occurred or be continuing, provided that with respect to amounts attributable under subclause (1) of clause (C) below, no Event of Default described under Section 6.01(a), (b), (e) or (f) shall have occurred or be continuing; and (B) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis, the Company could incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to Section 4.05(a); and (C) the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments declared or made after the Issue Date (including the proposed Restricted Payment) does not exceed the sum of (without duplication): (1) $300,000,000; plus (2) [reserved]; plus (3) (i) cumulative Consolidated EBITDA for each quarter commencing with the fiscal quarter commencing October 1, 2022 through the most recently ended fiscal quarter of the Company, minus (ii) 1.70 multiplied by cumulative Consolidated Interest Expense for the same period; plus (4) returns, profits, distributions and similar amounts received in cash or Cash Equivalents and the Fair Market Value of any in-kind amounts received by the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries on Investments made after the Issue Date using the amount under this clause (C) (not to exceed the amount of such Investments); plus (5) Investments of the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries in any Unrestricted Subsidiary made..."

Since these notes have 1L priority at AMC, this covenant is critical to maintaining their senior secured position. Permitted liens include: existing liens, liens securing permitted refinancing debt, purchase money security interests, and general baskets. Key risk: The Muvico drop-down structure means theatre assets were moved to a subsidiary where these notes only have 2L priority, effectively circumventing this lien limitation at the asset level. (a) The Company will not and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to create, incur or assume any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) (each, an “Initial Lien”) that secures obligations under any Indebtedness on any asset or property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary unless, in the case of Initial Liens on any asset or property that is not Collateral, the Notes are equally and ratably secured with (or, in the event the Lien relates to Junior Financing, are secured on a senior basis to) the obligations so secured. (b) Any Lien created for the benefit of Holders of the Notes pursuant to this Section 4.07 shall provide by its terms that such Lien be deemed automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien. In addition, in the event that an Initial Lien is or becomes a Permitted Lien, the Company may, at its option and without consent from any Holder, elect to release and discharge any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the preceding paragraph in respect of such Initial Lien."

Threshold requirements escalate with transaction size: Board resolution for transactions over $15 million, fairness opinion for transactions over $50 million. Critical context: The Muvico drop-down and intercompany arrangements (Alcohol Management Agreements, Management Services Agreement) are likely affiliate transactions that were structured to fall within the permitted baskets here.

After the Issue Date, any Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the Senior Credit Facilities or other debt exceeding $250M must also guarantee these Notes within 90 days.

This means some subsidiaries that guarantee DOC 2 may not be required to guarantee DOC 3.

If a Change of Control occurs (defined as acquisition of 40%+ voting stock, or certain board changes), the Company must offer to repurchase all notes at 101% of principal plus accrued interest . This is a standard high-yield put right that protects holders against an acquirer loading up the company with additional debt. Compared to other docs: DOC 2 and DOC 5 do NOT have a Change of Control put, making this provision unique to the AMC-level notes. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, unless the Company has previously or concurrently delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under Section 3.03, the Company will be required to make an offer (a “Change of Control Offer”) to purchase all outstanding Notes (as described in this Indenture) at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount (or such higher amount as the Company may determine (any Change of Control Offer at a higher amount, an “Alternate Offer”)) (such price, the “Change of Control Payment”) plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). Within 60 days following the date upon which the Change of Control occurred, the Company must send, electronically or by first class mail to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of the Depository, a notice to each Holder of Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, which notice shall govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer. Such notice will state: (1) that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Company; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 20 Business Days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); provided, that the Change of Control Payment Date shall be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date such notice is sent) as any or all such conditions referred to in clause (8) below shall be satisfied or waived; (3) that any Notes not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (4) that unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment plus accrued and unpaid interest on all properly tendered Notes, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close..."

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the obligations in this Section 4.12 may be satisfied by a parent of the Company; provided that to the extent such information relates to a parent of the Company, such information is accompanied by consolidating information, which may be unaudited, that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such parent, on the one hand, and the information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, on the other hand, and to the extent such information is in lieu of information required to be provided under this Section 4.12, such materials are accompanied by a report and opinion of an independent registered public accounting firm of nationally recognized standing, which..."

Key distinction from DOC 4: The cure period for covenant breaches is 60 days here vs. 30 days in the Credit Agreement, giving AMC slightly more room to cure under the indenture. “Event of Default,” wherever used herein, means any one of the following events: (a) default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, on any Note when and as the same shall become due and payable and in the currency required hereunder, whether at the due date thereof or upon acceleration, redemption or otherwise; (b) default in the payment of any interest on any Note when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; (c) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or agreement of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary contained in this Indenture or the Security Documents (other than a default in the performance, or breach, of a covenant or agreement which is specifically dealt with in clause (a) or (b)) and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 30 days after written notice shall have been given to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding; (d) (i) one or more defaults in the payment of principal on Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, in an aggregate amount of the greater of $250,000,000 or 25% of Consolidated EBITDA, when the same becomes due and payable at the stated maturity thereof, and such default or defaults shall have continued after any applicable grace period and shall not have been cured or waived or (ii) Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, in an aggregate amount of the greater of $250,000,000 or 25% of Consolidated EBITDA, shall have been accelerated or otherwise declared due and payable, or required to be prepaid or repurchased (other than by regularly scheduled prepayment) prior to the stated maturity thereof; (e) an involuntary proceeding shall be commenced or an involuntary petition shall be filed seeking (i) liquidation, court protection, reorganization or other relief in respect of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or its debts, or of a material part of its assets, under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect or (ii) the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, examiner, sequestrator, conservator or similar official for the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or for a material part of its assets, and, in any such case, such proceeding or petition shall continue undismissed or unstayed for 60 days..."

Bankruptcy triggers automatic acceleration. A majority of holders may rescind acceleration if defaults are cured and overdue amounts paid. Why it matters: The acceleration right is the holders' most powerful enforcement tool, converting a maturity-date obligation into an immediate one. Rescission provides an escape valve if the Company addresses the default. (a) If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(e) or (f)) occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee, by notice to the Company, or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding, by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, all the Notes to be due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(e) or (f) occurs and is continuing, then the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, all the Notes shall automatically become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. The Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Notes if in the reasonable judgment of the Trustee, acceleration is not in the interest of the Holders. (b) At any time after a declaration of acceleration has been made, but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as provided hereinafter in this Article, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if: (i) the Company has paid or deposited, or caused to be paid or deposited, with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay: (A) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; (B) all overdue interest on all Notes; (C) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Notes that has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate borne by the Notes; and (D) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate borne by the Notes; and (ii) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of principal of the Notes which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 6.04. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.

It has no obligation to act without satisfactory indemnity. Why it matters: Holders must provide indemnification before the Trustee will take enforcement action at their direction. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01: (a) The Trustee may rely on any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper person. The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document. The Trustee may, however, in its discretion make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney. (b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officers’ Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on the Officers’ Certificate or Opinion of Counsel. (c) The Trustee may act through agents and shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed with due care. (d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith that it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers; provided, however, that the Trustee’s conduct does not constitute willful misconduct or negligence. (e) The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders, unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee, to the extent satisfactory to the Trustee, security or indemnity against the loss, liability or expense (including attorneys’ fees) that might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction. (f) In no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for special, indirect, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, loss of profit) irrespective of whether the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. (g) The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a Trust Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Notes and this Indenture.

    "content": "Compensation and Indemnity. AMC must pay Trustee compensation, reimburse documented expenses, and indemnify against losses (except for willful misconduct or negligence). The Trustee has a prior lien on trust money and property. In bankruptcy, Trustee expenses are administrative expenses. Why it matters: The Trustee's administrative priority means its fees are paid before noteholders in a distressed scenario. The Company shall pay to the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee from time to time such compensation for its services as shall from time to time be agreed to in writing by the Company and the Trustee. The Trustee’s compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for all documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred or made by it, including costs of collection, in addition to the compensation for its services. Such expenses shall include the documented compensation and expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee’s agents, counsel, accountants and experts. The Company shall indemnify the Trustee against any and all loss, liability or expense (including documented attorneys’ fees) incurred by it in connection with the acceptance and administration of this trust and the performance of its duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not reimburse any expenses or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee’s own willful misconduct, negligence or bad faith. The Company need not pay for any settlement made by the Trustee without the Company’s consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. All indemnifications and releases from liability granted hereunder to the Trustee shall extend to its officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns. To secure the Company’s payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Notes on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee other than money or property held in trust to pay principal of and interest on particular Notes. The Company’s payment obligations pursuant to this Section shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and the discharge of this Indenture. When the Trustee incurs expenses after the occurrence of a Default specified in Section 6.01(e) or (f) with respect to the Company, the expenses are intended to constitute expenses of administration under the Bankruptcy Law. The provisions of this Section shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and the termination of this Indenture."

    "content": "Replacement of Trustee. The Trustee may resign by notifying the Company. A majority of holders may remove the Trustee. AMC must remove the Trustee if it fails eligibility requirements, becomes insolvent, or is incapable of acting. Why it matters: Holder ability to remove and replace provides recourse if the Trustee becomes unresponsive or conflicted. The Trustee may resign at any time by so notifying the Company. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and may appoint a successor Trustee. The Company shall remove the Trustee if: (a) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10; (b) the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent; (c) a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or (d) the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting. If the Trustee resigns, is removed by the Company or by the Holders a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and such Holders do not reasonably promptly appoint a successor Trustee, or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason (the Trustee in such event being referred to herein as the retiring Trustee), the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07. If a successor Trustee does not take office within 30 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee or the Holders of 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee. If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Note for at least six months may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee. Notwithstanding the replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section, the Company’s obligations under Section 7.07 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee."

The guarantee survives extensions, modifications, and waivers of the underlying obligations. Why it matters: Joint and several liability means any single Guarantor can be held responsible for the entire $360M outstanding. This is a direct AMC obligation, so the guarantee structure adds subsidiary-level claims. Subject to the provisions of this Article Eleven, each Guarantor hereby fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, jointly and severally with each other Guarantor, to each Holder of the Notes and the Trustee, the full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and all other obligations and liabilities of the Company under this Indenture and the Notes (including, without limitation, any interest, fees or expenses accruing subsequent to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, whether or not such interest, fees or expenses is an allowed claim under applicable state, federal or foreign law and the obligations under Section 7.07) (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the “Guarantor Obligations”). Each Guarantor agrees that the Guarantor Obligations will rank equally in right of payment with other indebtedness of such Guarantor, except to the extent such other Indebtedness is subordinate to the Guarantor Obligations. Each Guarantor further agrees (to the extent permitted by law) that the Guarantor Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound under this Article Eleven notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guarantor Obligation. Each Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of payment from and protest to the Company of any of the Guarantor Obligations and also waives notice of protest for non-payment. Each Guarantor waives notice of any default under the Notes or the Guarantor Obligations. Each Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (and not a guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder to any security held for payment of the Guarantor Obligations. Except as set forth in Section 11.02, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than payment of the Guarantor Obligations in full), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guarantor Obligations or otherwise.

The Initial Exchange Term Loans were issued as consideration for the open market purchase of existing term loans and the exchange of 2026 Second Lien Notes. Why it matters: Once repaid, Term Loans cannot be reborrowed -- this is a term loan, not a revolving facility, so every dollar prepaid permanently reduces the outstanding balance. (a) Each Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans of the same Class and Type made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments of the applicable Class.

Each Lender at its option may make any Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any SOFR Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum; provided that a SOFR Borrowing that results from a continuation of an outstanding SOFR Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to such outstanding Borrowing.

(d) Subject to terms and conditions hereof and set forth in the applicable Open Market Purchase Agreement or the Note Exchange Agreement, as applicable, the Borrowers agree to issue (i) the Initial Exchange Term Loans hereunder to the Lenders as consideration for (x) the sale and assignment of its Existing Term Loans through an open market purchase by AMC and (y) the sale of its 2026 Second Lien Notes, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the Open Market Purchase Agreements and the Note Exchange Agreement, as applicable. (e) On the date of each issuance of Subsequent Exchange Term Loans, each Subsequent Exchange Term Lender shall receive the Subsequent Exchange Term Loans as set forth in the applicable Subsequent Exchange Term Loan Documents.

If a lender fails to fund, the Agent may advance the amount and recover from the defaulting lender.

(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance on such assumption and in its sole discretion, make available to the Borrowers a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such share on demand of the Administrative Agent. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon demand of the Administrative Agent therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrowers, and the Borrowers agree to pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand.

(a) The Borrowers hereby unconditionally promise to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Term Loan of such Lender as provided in Section 2.10. (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrowers to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrowers to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof. (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein, provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrowers to pay any amounts due hereunder in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between the entries made pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Section, the accounts maintained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall control. (e) Any Lender may request through the Administrative Agent that Loans of any Class made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrowers shall execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form provided by the Administrative Agent (acting at the Direction of the Required Lenders) and approved by the Borrowers."

    "content": "Amortization of Term Loans. The Borrowers must repay 0.25% of the aggregate outstanding principal on the last business day of each quarter (March, June, September, December), with the balance due at maturity. Why it matters: At 1% annual amortization, this is minimal -- effectively a bullet maturity. The quarterly payments are roughly $5M against a $2B facility. Voluntary prepayments reduce future scheduled amortization payments. (a) Subject to adjustment pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section 2.10, the Borrowers shall repay Term Loan Borrowings on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December (commencing on September 30, 2024) in the principal amount of Term Loans equal to (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Term Loans multiplied by (ii) 0.25%. (b) To the extent not previously paid, all Term Loans shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date. (c) Any prepayment of a Term Loan Borrowing of any Class (x) pursuant to Section 2.11(a)(i) shall be applied to reduce the subsequent scheduled and outstanding repayments of the Term Loan Borrowings of such Class to be made pursuant to this Section as directed by the Borrowers (and absent such direction in direct order of maturity) and (y) pursuant to Section 2.11(c) or Section 2.11(d) shall be applied to reduce the subsequent scheduled and outstanding repayments of the Term Loan Borrowings of such Class to be made pursuant to this Section, or in direct order of maturity. (d) Prior to any repayment of any Term Loan Borrowings of any Class hereunder, the Borrowers shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings of the applicable Class to be repaid and shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing or by telephone (confirmed by hand delivery, facsimile or other electronic transmission) of such election not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, (x) in the case of SOFR Loans, three U.S. Government Securities Business Days before the scheduled date of such repayment and (y) in the case of ABR Loans, one Business Day before the scheduled date of such repayment. In the absence of a designation by the Borrowers as described in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall make such designation in its reasonable discretion with a view, but no obligation, to minimize breakage costs owing under Section 2.16. Each repayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the repaid Borrowing. Repayments of Term Loan Borrowings shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the amount repaid."

    "content": "Prepayment of Loans. Voluntary prepayments are permitted at any time, but carry significant premiums during the first 18 months: a Make-Whole Amount in the first 12 months and a 4% premium from months 12-18. After 18 months, prepayment is at par. The section also contains an elaborate discounted prepayment mechanism allowing lenders to bid on prepayments at below par. Why it matters: The make-whole and call premium protect lenders' expected return during the early period of the loan. The discounted prepayment provisions (Dutch auction, modified Dutch auction, and solicited offers) give the Borrowers flexibility to retire debt at market prices when it trades below par. (a) (i) The Borrowers shall have the right (and no Lender may decline to receive) at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, without premium or penalty (subject to the immediately succeeding proviso); provided that, solely with respect to a voluntary prepayment under this Section 2.11(a)(i), with respect to any voluntary prepayment of the Term Loans, whether the relevant prepayment or refinancing, as applicable, occurs before or after an Event of Default pursuant to Sections 7.01(h) or (i) or an acceleration of the Term Loans (x) prior to the twelve month anniversary of the Effective Date, the Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of each of the applicable Lenders the Make-Whole Amount in respect of the aggregate principal amount of the Loans so prepaid, repaid or refinanced and (y) on or after the twelve month anniversary of the Effective Date but on or prior to the eighteen-month anniversary of the Effective Date, the Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of each of the applicable Lenders, an amount equal to 4% of the aggregate amount of the applicable Term Loans prepaid (this clause (y), the “Prepayment Premium”). For the avoidance of doubt, no prepayment premium shall be payable hereunder in connection with any prepayment or refinancing of any Loan (whether the relevant prepayment or refinancing, as applicable, occurs before or after an Event of Default pursuant to Sections 7.01(h) or (i) or an acceleration of the Loans) on or after the eighteen-month anniversary of the Effective Date. (ii) Notwithstanding anything in any Loan Document to the contrary, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrowers may prepay the outstanding Term Loans on the following basis: (A) The Borrowers shall have the right to make a voluntary prepayment of Term Loans in cash at a discount to par (such prepayment, the “Discounted Term Loan Prepayment”) pursuant to the Borrowers Offer of Specified Discount Prepayment, Borrowers Solicitation of Discount Range Prepayment Offers or Borrowers Solicitation of Discounted Prepayment Offers, in each case made in accordance with this Section 2.11(a)(ii); provided that (x) the Borrowers shall not make any Borrowing of..."

Default interest adds an additional 2% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly for ABR loans and at the end of each Interest Period for SOFR loans. Why it matters: At current SOFR rates, the all-in cost is approximately 10.63%, making this one of the most expensive institutional term loans in the market. The 200bps default rate premium creates a strong incentive to cure any Event of Default quickly. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate. (b) The Loans comprising each SOFR Borrowing shall bear interest at Adjusted Term SOFR for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the sum of (x) the Applicable Rate plus (y) solely during the Ratings Trigger Period, 3.0%. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the continuance of an Event of Default, all outstanding principal amounts of each Loan and any fee or other amount payable by the Borrowers hereunder that is not paid when due shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 3.00% per annum plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount (including overdue interest), 3.00% per annum plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.

(e) All computations of interest for ABR Loans (including ABR Loans determined by reference to the Term SOFR) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed.

(b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15 or gives notice under Section 2.23, or (ii) the Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or to any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then the Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment and delegation), provided that (A) the Borrowers shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent to the extent such consent would be required under Section 9.04(b) for an assignment of Loans or Commitments, as applicable, which consents, in each case, shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, (B) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued but unpaid interest thereon, accrued but unpaid fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts), (C) the Borrowers or such assignee shall have paid (unless..."

These Subsequent Exchange Term Loans rank pari passu with the Initial Exchange Term Loans. Why it matters: This mechanism allowed AMC to continue rolling existing debt into this 1L facility after the initial closing, increasing the Term Loan's share of the capital structure. (a) After the Effective Date, any Borrower may, at any time, on one or more occasions pursuant to a Subsequent Exchange Term Loan Facility Amendment issue additional Exchange Term Loans that are pari passu with the Initial Exchange Term Loans (“Subsequent Exchange Term Loans”) (which loans shall thereafter for all purposes hereunder constitute Initial Exchange Term Loans) either (x) as consideration for additional open market purchases by any one or more of the Borrowers of Existing Term Loans as the Borrowers may elect pursuant to a Subsequent Exchange Term Loan Exchange Agreement or (y) for cash proceeds which are used to concurrently repurchase and/or refinance Existing Term Loans; provided, that: (i) [reserved], (ii) no issuance of Subsequent Exchange Term Loans in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.20 shall require the approval of any existing Lender, (iii) Subsequent Exchange Term Loans shall be pari passu in right of payment with the other Initial Exchange Term Loans in accordance with the terms hereof, (iv) any Subsequent Exchange Term Loans may participate in any voluntary prepayment of Term Loans as set forth in Section 2.11(a)(i), to the extent provided in such Section and Section 2.18(c), provided, that if multiple Classes of Term Loans are outstanding, each voluntary prepayment pursuant to Section 2.11(a)(i), shall be made on a pro rata basis for each Class that remains outstanding, (v) on the date of the Borrowing of any Subsequent Exchange Term Loans that will be of the same Class as any then-existing Class of Term Loans, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Sections 2.08 or 2.13 above, such Subsequent Exchange Term Loans shall be added to (and constitute a part of, be of the same Type as and, at the election of the Borrowers, have the same Interest Period as) each Borrowing of outstanding Term Loans of such Class on a pro rata basis (based on the relative sizes of such Borrowings), so that each Term Lender providing such Subsequent Exchange Term Loans will participate proportionately in each then-outstanding Borrowing of Term Loans of such Class; it being acknowledged that the application of this clause (a)(vi) may result in new Subsequent Exchange Term Loans having Interest Periods (the duration of which may be less than one month) that begin during an Interest Period then applicable to outstanding SOFR Loans of the relevant Class and which end on the last day of such Interest Period, (vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.20 or elsewhere in..."

Why it matters: This is a standard protective provision ensuring lenders are not forced to violate applicable law by maintaining the loan in its current form. If any Lender determines that any law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Term SOFR or Adjusted Term SOFR, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Term SOFR or Adjusted Term SOFR, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrowers through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue SOFR Loans or to convert ABR Loans to SOFR Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrowers shall, upon three Business Days’ notice from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), in the case of SOFR Loans, prepay or, if applicable, convert all SOFR Loans of such Lender to SOFR Loans either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans, and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Term SOFR or Adjusted Term SOFR, the Administrative Agent shall, during the period of such suspension, compute the Alternate Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Term SOFR or Adjusted Term SOFR component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Term SOFR or Adjusted Term SOFR. Each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers in writing promptly upon becoming aware that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Term SOFR or Adjusted Term SOFR. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted."

Fourteen separate conditions must be satisfied before closing, including: delivery of all loan documents and security agreements, organizational documents and board resolutions, UCC filings for perfected liens, solvency certificate, legal opinions from three law firms, KYC/anti-money-laundering documentation, payment of all fees, consummation of the Exchange Transactions, and no Material Adverse Effect since December 31, 2023. Why it matters: The extensive closing conditions reflect the complexity of the multi-tranche debt exchange that created this facility and the need to ensure all intercreditor agreements were properly in place. The effectiveness of this Agreement and the obligation of each Lender to make a Loan on the Effective Date is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of the following conditions: (a) The Administrative Agent shall have received copies of this Agreement, the Notes (to the extent requested at least three Business Days prior to the Effective Date), the Open Market Purchase Agreements, the Guaranty, the Pledge and Security Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreements, the Joinder to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, and the Agent Fee Letter, executed and delivered by each applicable Loan Party and each other party thereto. (b) The Administrative Agent shall have received, in respect of each Loan Party, (i) copies of each Organizational Document, and, to the extent applicable, certified as of the Effective Date or a date no earlier than 30 days prior thereto by the appropriate Governmental Authority; (ii) signature and incumbency certificates of the officers or directors (as applicable) of such Loan Party; (iii) resolutions of the board of directors or similar governing body of such Loan Party approving and authorizing the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party or by which it or its assets may be bound as of the Effective Date, certified as of the Effective Date by its secretary or an assistant secretary or other Responsible Officer as being in full force and effect without modification or amendment; and (iv) a good standing certificate (to the extent applicable in the relevant jurisdiction) from the applicable Governmental Authority of such Loan Party’s jurisdiction of incorporation, organization or formation, each dated within 30 days of the Effective Date. (c) Each document (including any UCC (or similar) financing statement) required by any Security Document or under applicable Requirements of Law to be filed, registered or recorded in order to create in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a perfected Lien on the Collateral, required to be delivered on the Effective Date pursuant to such Security Document, shall be in proper form for filing, registration or recordation (d) The Administrative Agent (or its counsel) shall have received a completed Information Certificate dated the..."

For each subsequent borrowing: (a) all representations must be true and correct in all material respects, (b) no Default or Event of Default exists or would result, and (c) a Borrowing Notice must be delivered. Each borrowing is deemed a representation by the Borrowers as to these conditions. Why it matters: This ensures that even after closing, the Borrowers cannot draw additional loans if their financial condition has deteriorated. The obligation of each Lender to make a Loan on the occasion of any Borrowing, is subject to receipt of the request therefor in accordance herewith and to the satisfaction of the following conditions: (a) The representations and warranties of each Loan Party set forth in the Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date of such Borrowing; provided that, to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, they shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date; provided, further, that any representation and warranty that is qualified as to “materiality,” “Material Adverse Effect” or similar language shall be true and correct in all respects on the date of such credit extension or on such earlier date, as the case may be. (b) At the time of and immediately after giving effect to such Borrowing, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom. (c) The Administrative Agent shall have received a fully executed and delivered Borrowing Notice in the form attached as Exhibit Q hereto. (d) To the extent this Section 4.02 is applicable, each Borrowing (provided that a conversion or a continuation of a Borrowing shall not constitute a “Borrowing” for purposes of this Section) shall be deemed to constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrowers on the date thereof as to the matters specified in clauses (a) and (b) of this Section."

Critically, financials must include a separate detailed presentation for both the Muvico Group and the AMC Group, including balance sheets, income statements, cash flows, and key operating metrics (ATP, attendance, theatres, screens, EBITDA, rent). Why it matters: As the senior-most tranche (1L at both AMC and Muvico), Term Loan lenders have the strongest information rights and are typically the first to detect covenant deterioration. The separate Muvico/AMC reporting requirement gives lenders visibility into the ring-fenced entity structure. (a) AMC will furnish to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of each Lender, beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 and thereafter, on or before the date on which such financial statements are required or permitted to be filed with the SEC (or, if such financial statements are not required to be filed with the SEC, on or before the date that is 90 days after the end of each such fiscal year of AMC), an audited consolidated balance sheet and audited consolidated statements of income and cash flows of AMC as of the end of and for such year, and related notes thereto, setting forth in each case in comparative form the figures for the previous fiscal year (which comparative form may be based on pro forma financial information to the extent any previous fiscal year includes a period occurring prior to the Effective Date), all reported on by Ernst & Young Global Limited or other independent public accountants of recognized national standing (without a “going concern” qualification (but may be subject to a “going concern” or like qualification or exception) and without any qualification or exception as to the scope of such audit (other than any exception or explanatory paragraph, but not a qualification, that is expressly solely with respect to, or expressly resulting solely from, (A) an upcoming maturity date of any Indebtedness occurring within one year from the time such opinion is delivered or (B) any potential inability to satisfy a financial maintenance covenant on a future date or in a future period)) to the effect that such consolidated financial statements present fairly in all material respects the financial position and results of operations and cash flows of AMC and its Subsidiaries as of the end of and for such year on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP consistently applied; (b) commencing with the financial statements for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024, on or before the date on which such financial statements are required or permitted to be filed with the SEC (or, if such financial..."

(b) Not later than five days after delivery of financial statements pursuant to Section 5.01(a), the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate executed by a Responsible Officer of each Borrower (i) setting forth the information required pursuant to Schedules I through IV of the Pledge and Security Agreement or confirming that there has been no change in such information since the Effective Date or the date of the most recent certificate delivered pursuant to this Section and (ii) certifying that all notices required to be given prior to the date of such certificate by this Section 5.03 and 5.12 have been given."

The Borrowers will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain within thirty (30) calendar days after the Effective Date and maintain (a) a public corporate credit rating issued by S&P and Moody’s (but not to maintain a specific rating) and (b) a public credit rating of the Term Loans made available under this Agreement issued by S&P and Moody’s (but not to maintain a specific rating)."

No preferred equity or disqualified equity may be issued. Why it matters: The Term Loan's debt incurrence baskets are tighter than those in the indentures, reflecting its senior priority position.

Why it matters: As the 1L tranche, the Credit Agreement's lien covenant is the strictest. It controls what additional secured debt can be issued and at what priority level. The specific carve-outs for the 1.25L, 1.5L, and 2L tranches in the Muvico structure were negotiated into this covenant.

The Borrowers themselves may merge only if they are the surviving entity. Why it matters: This prevents the corporate structure from being reorganized in a way that moves assets outside the collateral package or changes the lien priority waterfall that lenders relied upon when underwriting. The Borrowers will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, merge into or consolidate or amalgamate with any other Person, or permit any other Person to merge into or consolidate with it, or liquidate or dissolve, except that: (a) any Subsidiary may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with (i) any Borrower; provided that such Borrower shall be the continuing or surviving Person or (ii) one or more other Subsidiaries of the Borrowers; provided that when any Subsidiary Loan Party is merging or amalgamating with another Subsidiary either (A) the continuing or surviving Person shall be a Subsidiary Loan Party or (B) if the continuing or surviving Person is not a Subsidiary Loan Party, the acquisition of such Subsidiary Loan Party by such surviving Subsidiary is permitted under Section 6.04; (b) any Subsidiary may liquidate or dissolve or change its legal form if the Borrowers determine in good faith that such action is in the best interests of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries and is not materially disadvantageous to the Lenders; (c) any Subsidiary may make a Disposition of all or substantially all of its assets (upon voluntary liquidation or otherwise) to another Subsidiary or to any Borrower; provided that if the transferor in such a transaction is a Loan Party, then either (A) the transferee must be a Loan Party, (B) to the extent constituting an Investment, such Investment must be an Investment in a Subsidiary that is not a Loan Party permitted by Section 6.04 or (C) to the extent constituting a Disposition to a Subsidiary that is not a Loan Party, such Disposition is for Fair Market Value and any promissory note or other non-cash consideration received in respect thereof is an Investment in a Subsidiary that is not a Loan Party permitted by Section 6.04; (d) the Borrowers may merge, amalgamate or consolidate with any other Person; provided that such Borrower shall be the continuing or surviving Person; (e) [reserved]; (f) any Subsidiary may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with any other Person in order to effect an Investment permitted pursuant to Section 6.04; provided that the continuing or surviving Person shall be a Subsidiary, which together with each of the Subsidiaries, shall have complied with the requirements of Sections 5.11 and 5.12; (g) [reserved]; and (h) any Subsidiary may effect a merger, dissolution,..."

Critically, investments by the Muvico Group in the AMC Group require compliance with Section 6.12 restrictions. Why it matters: Investment restrictions prevent AMC from deploying capital outside the secured perimeter. The tight intercompany investment controls preserve the ring-fenced Muvico structure that protects 1L collateral. (a) Permitted Investments at the time such Permitted Investment is made; (b) loans or advances to officers, directors and employees of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries (i) for reasonable and customary business-related travel, entertainment, relocation and analogous ordinary business purposes, (ii) in connection with such Person’s purchase of Equity Interests in the Top Borrower (or any direct or indirect parent thereof) (provided that the amount of such loans and advances made in cash to such Person shall be contributed to the Top Borrower in cash as common equity or Qualified Equity Interests) and (iii) for purposes not described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii); provided that Investments made pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) hereof are made in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices; provided further that at the time of incurrence thereof and after giving Pro Forma Effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time in reliance on clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) hereof shall not exceed $1,000,000; (c) Investments (i) by any member of the Muvico Group (x) in any member of the Muvico Group that is a Loan Party (including as a result of a Delaware LLC Division) or (y) subject to Section 6.12, in any member of the AMC Group (other than the Odeon Group) that is a Loan Party, (ii) by any Subsidiary that is not a Loan Party in any other Subsidiary that is also not a Loan Party, (iii) by any member of the AMC Group in any Loan Party; and (iv) by any Borrower or any Subsidiary (including as a result of a Delaware LLC Division) in the Odeon Group; provided that all such Investments are made (x) solely to fund the business operations of the Odeon Group, (y) in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices and (z) not for the purposes of materially reducing the value of the Collateral or disadvantaging the Lenders in respect of their rights as creditors relative to other creditors; (v) [reserved], and (vi) Permitted Existing Debt Purchases.

No Dispositions may be made to Affiliates. Why it matters: The Term Loan's asset sale restrictions are tighter than the indentures. The $1M cash-consideration threshold and $5M general basket are extremely restrictive for a company of AMC's size. The 100% cash requirement (vs. 75% in the indentures) and the affiliate sale prohibition ensure maximum value preservation for 1L lenders.

The Borrowers may not designate any indebtedness other than the Loan Document Obligations as \"Designated Senior Indebtedness\" under any indenture or subordinated debt documentation. Why it matters: Designated Senior Indebtedness status enables payment blockage rights -- the ability to block interest payments on junior debt during a default. By reserving this designation exclusively for the Term Loan, the Borrowers ensure no other creditor can exercise this powerful enforcement tool. The Borrowers shall not, nor permit any of their Subsidiaries to, designate any Indebtedness, other than the Loan Document Obligations as “Designated Senior Indebtedness” (or any comparable term enabling the holders thereof to issue payment blockages and exercise other remedies in connection therewith or related thereto) under and as defined in the Indentures and any documentation with respect to any other subordinated Indebtedness of the Borrowers and each of their Subsidiaries."

Key restrictions: (a) Material Property may not be transferred outside its group (Muvico assets stay in Muvico, AMC assets stay in AMC); (b) no non-Loan Party may own Material Property; (c) Muvico may not transfer non-cash assets to the AMC Group; (d) Exchangeable Note premiums must be paid in equity, not cash; (e) Muvico must enforce Intercompany Agreements, maintain separate accounts and books, observe corporate formalities, and keep assets separate; (f) AMC must comply with Intercompany Agreements and may not amend them adversely; (g) no amendments to the Existing Credit Agreement or indentures that affect maturity, subordination, or intercreditor terms adversely. Why it matters: Section 6.12 is the legal foundation of the Muvico ring-fence. It prevents value leakage between entity groups and ensures the structural protections that 1L lenders relied upon cannot be eroded through intercompany maneuvering. (a) (i) The Borrowers shall not, nor permit any of their Subsidiaries to, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any Material Property (whether pursuant to a sale, lease, license, transfer, investment, restricted payment, dividend or otherwise or relating to the exclusive rights thereto) to any person other than (A) in the case of any Material Property owned by any member of the AMC Group, any Loan Party that is a member of the AMC Group or the Muvico Group, or (B) in the case of any Material Property owned by any member of the Muvico Group, any Loan Party that is a member of the Muvico Group, in each case, other than the grant of a non-exclusive license of intellectual property on arm’s length (i.e. market) terms and economics to any Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business for a bona fide business purpose, (ii) no non-Loan Party shall own or hold an exclusive license to any Material Property, (iii) Odeon Holdco shall not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any Capital Stock issued by Odeon (except pursuant to the Odeon Share Pledge), and (iv) no Person other than Odeon Holdco or a wholly-owned subsidiary thereof may be a lender of any portion of the Odeon-AMC Notes; provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the Transactions shall be permitted in all respects and (y) the Odeon-AMC Notes may be cancelled or terminated. (b) The Borrowers shall not, nor permit any of their Subsidiaries to, form or acquire any Subsidiary after the Effective Date that is an Excluded Subsidiary (other than a member of the Odeon Group) or permit any Loan Party to become an Excluded Subsidiary. (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no member of the Muvico Group shall transfer (including by Investment or Restricted Payment), sell, assign or otherwise effect a Disposition of any asset or property that is not cash to any member of the AMC Group or the Odeon Group other than licenses of Intellectual..."

    "content": "Cash Hoarding -- UNIQUE PROVISION. This is a covenant found only in the Credit Agreement and not in any of the indentures. It caps Available Cash at $240M for the AMC Group (excluding Odeon) and $150M for the Odeon Group, tested as of the last day of each calendar month. The Muvico Group must have received at least $58.5M of Available Cash at closing, and the AMC Group was required to transfer excess cash to Muvico by July 31, 2024. Transfers from Muvico to AMC/Odeon are restricted to ordinary-course operating costs and may not cause the caps to be exceeded. A 3-business-day cure period applies if caps are breached. After two consecutive breaches, bi-monthly testing kicks in. Why this is critical: Cash Hoarding prevents AMC from stockpiling cash while the Term Loan remains outstanding. In a distressed situation, companies often try to hoard cash to build a \"war chest\" for bankruptcy negotiations or to maintain leverage over creditors. This provision forces AMC to use excess liquidity to deleverage, directly benefiting Term Loan holders. With $417M of cash on the balance sheet , this covenant is actively relevant and likely constraining AMC's ability to accumulate additional cash reserves. (a) By July 31, 2024, the AMC Group will in good faith transfer an amount of Available Cash to the Muvico Group required for the Muvico Group to operate in the ordinary course of business; provided that in any event the amount of Available Cash transferred to the Muvico Group shall be no less than total Available Cash of AMC and its consolidated Subsidiaries less $390,000,000, and as of the Effective Date the Muvico Group will have at least $58,500,000 of Available Cash. (b) The Muvico Group may only transfer cash or Permitted Investments to the AMC Group or the Odeon Group if (i) such transfer is made in good faith to pay operating and/or capital costs or cash expenses in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices (and such transaction is not intended to materially reduce the value of the Collateral (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, Investments in the Odeon Group otherwise made in compliance with this Agreement, as in effect on the Effective Date, (including Section 6.04) are not deemed to reduce the material value of the Collateral) or disadvantage the Lenders in respect of their rights as creditors relative to other creditors) and (ii) to the Top Borrower’s knowledge the total amount of Available Cash after giving pro forma effect to any such transfer shall not exceed (x) $240,000,000 for the AMC Group (other than the Odeon Group) or (y) $150,000,000 for the Odeon Group. (c) As of the last day of each calendar month, commencing with the calendar month ending July 31, 2024, the Borrowers shall not permit Available Cash to exceed (i) $240,000,000 for the AMC Group (other than the Odeon Group) or (ii) $150,000,000 for the Odeon Group.

Upon an Event of Default, the Required Lenders can accelerate all loans and terminate commitments. Bankruptcy triggers automatic acceleration. The Applicable Premium (make-whole or 4% prepayment premium) is payable even upon acceleration. Key differences from indentures: The Credit Agreement has (1) shorter cure periods (30 days vs. 60 days), (2) immediate default for negative covenant breaches (no cure), and (3) a Change of Control trigger. This makes the Term Loan the \"hair trigger\" in the capital structure. If any of the following events (any such event, an “Event of Default”) shall occur: (a) any Loan Party shall fail to pay any principal of any Loan when and as the same shall become due and payable and in the currency required hereunder, whether at the due date thereof or at a date fixed for prepayment thereof or otherwise; (b) any Loan Party shall fail to pay any interest on any Loan, or any reimbursement obligation in respect of any fee or any other amount (other than an amount referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section) payable under any Loan Document, when and as the same shall become due and payable, and such failure shall continue unremedied for a period of five Business Days; (c) any representation or warranty made or deemed made by or on behalf of any Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries in or in connection with any Loan Document or any amendment or modification thereof or waiver thereunder, or in any report, certificate, financial statement or other document furnished pursuant to or in connection with any Loan Document or any amendment or modification thereof or waiver thereunder, shall prove to have been incorrect in any material respect when made or deemed made; (d) any Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries shall fail to observe or perform any covenant, condition or agreement contained in Sections 5.02(a), 5.04 (with respect to the existence of the Borrower) or 5.14 or in Article VI; provided, that, any Event of Default under Section 6.13(c) is subject to cure as provided in Section 6.13(e) and an Event of Default with respect to such Section shall not occur until the expiration of the 3rd Business Day after the date on which the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries have knowledge of..."

The Agent relationship is administrative, not fiduciary. The Collateral Agent holds and enforces liens on behalf of all Secured Parties. Why it matters: The Agent acts at the Direction of the Required Lenders on most matters, meaning a majority of lenders (by outstanding principal) control enforcement decisions. (a) Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB to serve as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent under the Loan Documents, and authorizes the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent to take such actions and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

The use of the term “agent” herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.

    "content": "Collateral and Guaranty Matters. The Agent may release collateral and guarantees in connection with permitted transactions (asset sales, subsidiary dispositions) without lender consent. The Agent's lien automatically releases upon full payment of all obligations. Why it matters: This provision streamlines permitted transactions by eliminating the need for individual lender approvals for collateral releases, but it also means lenders must rely on the Agent to verify that the underlying transaction is actually permitted. No Lender shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce any Guarantee of the Secured Obligations, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies under the Loan Documents may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders in accordance with the terms thereof. In the event of a foreclosure by the Administrative Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or other disposition, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser or licensor of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale or other disposition, and the Administrative Agent, as agent for and representative of the Lenders (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or their respective individual capacities unless Required Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any of the Secured Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any collateral payable by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders at such sale or other disposition. Each Lender, whether or not a party hereto, will be deemed, by its acceptance of the benefits of the Collateral and of the Guarantees of the Secured Obligations, to have agreed to the foregoing provisions. Each Lender party to this Agreement hereby appoints the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent to act as its agent under and in connection with the relevant Security Documents."

The Agent can claw back erroneous payments without regard to whether the recipient knew the payment was in error. Why it matters: This protects the facility from operational mistakes in payment processing and ensures misdirected funds are recoverable. (a) Each Lender hereby agrees that if the Administrative Agent notifies a Lender or Secured Party or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender or Secured Party (any such Lender, Secured Party or other recipient, a “Erroneous Payment Recipient”) in writing that the Administrative Agent has determined in its reasonable discretion that the Administrative Agent or its Affiliates mistakenly transmitted funds to such Erroneous Payment Recipient, as a result of a clerical, mechanical, technological or other error, whether or not known to such Erroneous Payment Recipient (any such funds, whether as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, individually and collectively, an “Erroneous Payment”) and demands in writing the return of such Erroneous Payment (or a portion thereof), such Erroneous Payment Recipient shall make commercially reasonable efforts to promptly return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a written demand was made, in same day funds (in the currency so received).

(b) Without limiting the immediately preceding clause (a), each Lender or Secured Party hereby further agrees that if it (or an Erroneous Payment Recipient on its behalf) receives a payment from the Administrative Agent (x) in a different amount or on a different date than the amount or date specified in a notice of payment sent by the Administrative Agent with respect to such payment, (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a notice of payment sent by the Administrative Agent, or (z) that such Lender or Secured Party (or Erroneous Payment Recipient on its behalf) otherwise becomes aware was transmitted, or received, in error or by mistake (in whole or in part) then, in each case, such Lender or Secured Party shall presume that an error has been made (absent written confirmation from the Administrative Agent) and shall promptly (and, in all events, within one Business Day of its knowledge of such error) notify the Administrative Agent of its receipt of such payment, the details thereof (in reasonable detail) and that it is so notifying the Administrative Agent pursuant to this ‎Section 8.12(b).

    "content": "Waivers; Amendments. Most amendments require consent of the Required Lenders (majority by outstanding principal). However, certain \"sacred rights\" require unanimous lender consent: (a) reducing principal or interest rate; (b) extending maturity or payment dates; (c) releasing all or substantially all collateral or guarantees; (d) changing the Required Lender threshold; (e) changing the pro rata payment provisions. The Borrowers may amend solely with the Administrative Agent to cure errors, add guarantors/collateral, or make technical corrections. Why it matters: The sacred rights protections prevent a majority of lenders from forcing concessions on a minority. Every lender has veto power over reductions in payment amounts, extensions, or collateral releases -- the core economic terms of the deal. (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. No notice or demand on the Borrowers in any case shall entitle the Borrowers to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. (b) Except as expressly provided herein, neither any Loan Document nor any provision thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent (to the extent that such waiver, amendment or modification does not affect the rights, duties, privileges or obligations of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall execute such waiver, amendment or other modification to the extent approved by the Required Lenders) and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are parties thereto,..."

Liens and guarantees automatically release when: (a) all obligations are paid in full; (b) the relevant collateral is disposed of in a permitted transaction; (c) a subsidiary ceases to be a Loan Party in a permitted transaction; or (d) the release is approved by the Required Lenders. Why it matters: Automatic release upon permitted transactions is operationally necessary, but it means the collateral pool shrinks every time an asset sale occurs -- reinforcing the importance of the tight asset sale restrictions in Section 6.05. Subject to Section 6.12 and the final paragraph of this Section 9.15, a Subsidiary Loan Party shall automatically be released from its obligations under the Loan Documents, and all security interests created by the Security Documents in Collateral owned by (and to the extent constituting Excluded Assets, upon the request of the Borrowers, the Equity Interests of) such Subsidiary Loan Party shall be automatically released, upon the request of the Borrowers, upon any Subsidiary Loan Party becoming an Excluded Subsidiary. Upon (i) any sale or other transfer by any Loan Party (other than to the Borrowers or any other Loan Party) of any Collateral in a transaction permitted under this Agreement or (ii) the effectiveness of any written consent to the release of the security interest created under any Security Document in any Collateral or the release of any Loan Party from its Guarantee under the Guaranty pursuant to Section 9.02, the security interests in such Collateral created by the Security Documents or such guarantee shall be automatically released. Upon the occurrence of the Termination Date, all obligations under the Loan Documents and all security interests created by the Security Documents shall be automatically released. In connection with any termination or release pursuant to this Section, the Administrative Agent shall execute and deliver to any Loan Party, at such Loan Party’s expense, all documents that such Loan Party shall reasonably request to evidence such termination or release. Any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this Section shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent. The Lenders irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent to (i) release or subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 6.02 (v) or (viii)(A) or (xxi) to the extent required by the terms of the obligations secured by such Liens pursuant to documents reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent (acting at the Direction of the Required Lenders)) and (ii) subordinate any Lien on any Mortgaged Property if required under the terms of any lease, easement, right of way or similar agreement effecting the Mortgaged Property provided such lease, easement, right of way or..."

    "content": "The Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent (WSFS). This article governs the appointment, authority, rights, and protections of Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB as both Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent. Key provisions include: the Agent acts solely as a contractual representative (not a fiduciary); the Agent has broad exculpation from liability (except for gross negligence or willful misconduct); lenders cannot rely solely on the Agent's due diligence; the Agent can resign with 30 days notice; and the Agent has authority to release collateral and guarantees in connection with permitted transactions. Why it matters: The Agent is the central operational hub of the facility -- it processes payments, distributes information, and coordinates enforcement actions on behalf of all lenders."

Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a record date (the “Special Record Date”) for the payment of such defaulted interest, which date shall be not more than fifteen (15) days and not less than ten (10) days prior to the Special Interest Payment Date and not less than ten (10) days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date, and in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such defaulted interest and the Special Record Date and Special Interest Payment Date therefor to be given in the manner provided for in Section 13.02, not less than ten (10) days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such defaulted interest and the Special Record Date and Special Interest Payment Date therefor having been so given, such defaulted interest shall be paid on the Special Interest Payment Date to the Persons in whose names the Notes (or their respective predecessor Notes) are registered at the Close of Business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable. The Company may make payment of any defaulted interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.

Upon a Fundamental Change (defined to include mergers, asset sales, delisting, and change of control events), each holder may require the Company to repurchase their notes at 100% of principal plus accrued interest . This gives holders a floor value protection: even if the exchange option is underwater, they can put notes back at par in the event of a major corporate change. (a) Subject to the other terms of this Section 3.10, if a Fundamental Change occurs, then each Holder will have the right (the “Fundamental Change Repurchase Right”) to require the Company to repurchase such Holder’s Notes (or any portion thereof in amounts of $1.00 or whole multiples of $1.00 in excess thereof) on the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date for such Fundamental Change for a cash purchase price equal to the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price. (b) If the principal amount of the Notes has been accelerated in accordance with this Indenture and such acceleration has not been rescinded on or before the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date for a Repurchase Upon Fundamental Change (except in the case of an acceleration resulting from a Default by the Company in the payment of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price with respect to the Notes), then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 3.10(a), (i) the Company may not repurchase any Notes pursuant to this Section 3.10; and (ii) the Company will cause any Notes theretofore surrendered for such Repurchase Upon Fundamental Change (but not yet repurchased) to be returned to the Holders thereof (or, if applicable with respect to Global Notes, cancel any instructions for book-entry transfer to the Company, the Trustee or the Paying Agent of the applicable beneficial interest in such Notes in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC). (c) [reserved]. (d) If a Fundamental Change Repurchase Date is after a record date and on or before the next Interest Payment Date, then (i) the Holder of such Note at the Close of Business on such record date will be entitled, notwithstanding such Repurchase Upon Fundamental Change, to receive, on or, at the Company’s election, before such Interest Payment Date, the unpaid interest that would have accrued on such Note to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date (assuming, solely for these purposes, that such Note remained outstanding through such Interest Payment Date, if such Fundamental Change Repurchase Date is before such Interest Payment Date); and (ii) the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price will not include accrued and unpaid interest on such Note to, but excluding, such Fundamental Change Repurchase Date. For the avoidance of doubt, if an Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day and such Fundamental Change Repurchase Date occurs on the Business Day immediately after such Interest Payment Date, then (x) accrued and unpaid interest on Notes to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date will be paid on the next Business Day to Holders..."

A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative."

The Trustee has a lien on the notes and proceeds senior to the holders' claims to secure its compensation. Why it matters: In a distressed scenario, the Trustee's fees and expenses come off the top, reducing amounts available for noteholders. The Company shall pay to the Trustee (acting in any capacity hereunder) and any predecessor Trustee from time to time such compensation for its services as shall from time to time be agreed to in writing by the Company and the Trustee. The Trustee’s compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee (acting in any capacity hereunder) upon request for all documented expenses incurred or made by it, including costs of collection, in addition to the compensation for its services. Such expenses shall include the documented compensation and expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee’s agents, counsel, accountants and experts. The Company shall indemnify the Trustee (acting in any capacity hereunder) against any and all loss, liability or expense (including documented attorneys’ fees) incurred by it in connection with the acceptance and administration of this trust and the performance of its duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not reimburse any expenses or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee’s own willful misconduct or gross negligence. The Company need not pay for any settlement made by the Trustee without the Company’s consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. All rights, protections, indemnifications and releases from liability granted hereunder to the Trustee shall extend to it acting in any capacity hereunder and its officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns. To secure the Company’s payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Notes on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee other than money or property held in trust to pay principal of and interest on particular Notes. The Company’s payment obligations pursuant to this Section shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and the discharge of this Indenture.

A successor trustee must be appointed before the resignation becomes effective. This ensures continuous oversight of the indenture. The Trustee may resign at any time by so notifying the Company. The Required Holders may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and may appoint a successor Trustee by so notifying the resigning Trustee of its replacement. The Company shall remove the Trustee if: (a) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10; (b) the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent; (c) a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or (d) the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting. If the Trustee resigns, is removed by the Company or by the Required Holders and such Holders do not reasonably promptly (but in any event, within thirty (30) days following such resignation or removal) appoint a successor Trustee, or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason (the Trustee in such event being referred to herein as the retiring Trustee), the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07. If a successor Trustee does not take office within sixty (60) days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee or the Holders of 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee. If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Note for at least six months may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee. Notwithstanding the replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section, the Company’s obligations under Section 7.07 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee."

    "content": "Exchange Privilege. Each holder has the right to exchange their notes for AMC common stock at the applicable Exchange Rate. The exchange is exercisable at any time prior to maturity (subject to certain blackout periods). The Exchange Rate represents the number of shares of AMC common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. Key detail: Unlike standard convertibles, the exchange is into AMC parent stock even though the notes are issued by Muvico. This creates structural complexity in the equity delivery mechanism. (a) Subject to the conditions and upon compliance with the provisions of this Article X, each Holder shall have the right, at such Holder’s option, to exchange all or any portion (if the portion to be exchanged is $1.00 principal amount or an integral multiple thereof) of its Notes with the Company at any time during the period commencing on the Exchangeability Effective Date and ending at the Close of Business on the second Trading Day immediately preceding the final maturity date of the Notes (a “Voluntary Exchange”). (b) Upon exchange of Notes, such Holder shall be entitled to receive from the Company the amounts and types of consideration due upon exchange specified in this Article X based on the applicable Exchange Rate then in effect and the principal amount of and (subject to Section 10.03) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes being exchanged on the applicable Exchange Date. The Exchange Rate in effect at any time shall be subject to adjustment in the manner set forth herein. (c) The Company shall deliver to the Trustee on or prior to the fifth calendar day immediately prior to the expected Exchangeability Effective Date, as determined by the Company in good faith, a written notice stating the expected Exchangeability Effective Date."

(c) The number of shares of Common Stock and amount of cash, if any, that the Company is required to pay or deliver (or cause to be paid or delivered), as the case may be, in respect of any exchange of Notes pursuant to a Voluntary Exchange (the “Exchange Consideration”) shall be computed as follows: (i) if the Company elects to satisfy the Company’s exchange obligations with respect to any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes subject to such Voluntary Exchange through shares of Common Stock, the Company shall deliver (or cause..."

The guarantee is a primary obligation, not merely a surety, meaning holders can proceed directly against guarantors without first pursuing the Company.

Subject to the provisions of this Article XI, each Guarantor hereby fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, jointly and severally with each other Guarantor, to each Holder of the Notes and the Trustee, the full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and all other obligations and liabilities of the Company under this Indenture and the Notes (including, without limitation, any interest, fees or expenses accruing subsequent to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, whether or not such interest, fees or expenses is an allowed claim under applicable state, federal or foreign law and the obligations under Section 7.07) (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the “Guarantor Obligations”).

Except as set forth in Section 11.02, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than payment of the Guarantor Obligations in full), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guarantor Obligations or otherwise.

If the Issuer defaults in a payment of interest on the Notes, the Issuer shall pay the defaulted interest (plus interest on such defaulted interest at the rate borne by the Notes to the extent lawful) in any lawful manner. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of defaulted interest proposed to be paid on each Notes and the date (not less than 30 days after such notice) of the proposed payment (the “Special Interest Payment Date”), and at the same time the Issuer shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such defaulted interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such defaulted interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a record date (the “Special Record Date”) for the payment of such defaulted interest, which date shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the Special Interest Payment Date and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer of such Special Record Date, and in the name and at the expense of the Issuer, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such defaulted interest and the Special Record Date and Special Interest Payment Date therefor to be given in the manner provided for in Section 13.02, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such defaulted interest and the Special Record Date and Special Interest Payment Date therefor having been so given, such defaulted interest shall be paid on the Special Interest Payment Date to the Persons in whose names the Notes (or their respective predecessor Notes) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable. The Issuer may make payment of any defaulted interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Issuer to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Note delivered under this Indenture upon registration of, transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Note shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Note."

The Issuer must use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the notes on a recognized stock exchange (typically the Irish Stock Exchange or Luxembourg Stock Exchange). Why it matters: Certain European institutional investors are required to hold only listed securities. Delisting could force selling, which would depress the notes' trading price. This covenant is found only in DOC 6 among all AMC debt instruments. The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange for so long as the Notes are outstanding; provided that if the Issuer is unable to obtain admission to listing of the Notes on the Exchange or if at any time the Issuer determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of such Notes on another “recognised stock exchange” (within the meaning of Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act of 2007 of the United Kingdom (“ITA”) for the purposes of Section 987 of the ITA) (in which case, references herein to the Exchange will be deemed to refer to such other “recognised stock exchange”). In no event will the Company be required to obtain or maintain the listing of the Notes on any exchange that requires financial reporting for any fiscal period in addition to the fiscal periods required by Section 4.13."

Change of Control is defined as (a) acquisition of more than 50% of voting stock of the Company (Odeon Cinemas Group) by a person other than AMC, or (b) sale of all or substantially all assets of Odeon. Why it matters: If AMC sells its European cinema operations, Odeon noteholders can force a put at 101.

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, unless the Issuer has previously or concurrently delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under Section 3.03, the Issuer will be required to make an offer (a “Change of Control Offer”) to purchase all outstanding Notes (as described in this Indenture) at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount (or such higher amount as the Company may determine (any Change of Control Offer at a higher amount, an “Alternate Offer”)) (such price, the “Change of Control Payment”) plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

(a) If the Notes are accelerated or otherwise become due prior to the stated maturity of the Notes, in each case, as a result of an Event of Default (including, but not limited to, upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy or insolvency event (including the acceleration of claims by operation of law)), the amount of principal of, accrued and unpaid interest and premium on the Notes that becomes due and payable shall equal the redemption price applicable with respect to an optional redemption of the Notes, in effect on the date of such acceleration as if such acceleration were an optional redemption of the Notes accelerated.

(b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default: (i) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and (ii) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, and will be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein).

(d) Every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this Section. (e) The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Issuer. (f) Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. (g) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers. (h) The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a Trust Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Notes and this Indenture."

The Security Agent role is more extensive than the US \"Collateral Agent\" concept, reflecting the multi-jurisdictional nature of the collateral and the Agreed Security Principles framework. Why it matters: The Security Agent coordinates collateral enforcement across the UK, Germany, Spain, Italy, and other markets, each with different legal procedures. (a) The Issuer and each of the Holders by acceptance of the Notes hereby designates and appoints the Security Agent as its agent under this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer and each of the Holders by acceptance of the Notes hereby irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Security Agent by the terms of this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, and consents and agrees to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and each Security Document, as the same may be in effect or may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with their respective terms. The Security Agent agrees to act as such on the express conditions contained in this Section 12.07. Each Holder agrees that any action taken by the Security Agent in accordance with the provision of this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, and the exercise by the Security Agent of any rights or remedies set forth herein and therein shall be authorized and binding upon all Holders. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the duties of the Security Agent shall be ministerial and administrative in nature, and the Security Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein and in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement to which the Security Agent is a party, nor shall the Security Agent have or be deemed to have any trust or other fiduciary relationship with the Trustee, any Holder or any Grantor, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or otherwise exist against the Security Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term “agent” in this Indenture with reference to the Security Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship..."

    "content": "Payment of Interest; Issuance of PIK Notes; Notice of PIK Interest. The Company must elect cash or PIK before each interest period and provide advance notice of the election. PIK interest is paid by issuing additional notes rather than cash. Why it matters: The toggle election reveals Muvico's cash flow priorities. Consistently choosing PIK signals cash preservation needs, while choosing cash signals improving financial health. Holders should monitor these elections as a leading indicator of financial stress. (a) The Company shall have the option, at its election, to pay interest on the Notes in either cash (“Cash Interest”) or in kind (“PIK Interest”). To elect PIK Interest for an interest payment period, the Company shall deliver a written notice to the Trustee and the Holders prior to the fifteenth (15th) calendar day immediately prior to the interest payment date for such interest payment period, which notice shall state the form of interest payment with respect to such interest period and the total amount of interest to be paid on such interest payment date (a “PIK Election”). If a PIK Election is made in accordance with the previous sentence, such PIK Interest shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.14(b) (each a “PIK Payment”) at a rate of 8.00% per annum (the “PIK Rate”). In the event that the Company does not make a timely PIK Election in accordance with this clause (a) for an interest payment period, then the Company shall pay Cash Interest for such interest payment period at a rate of 6.00% per annum (the “Cash Rate”). (b) PIK Interest on the Notes, if elected to be paid, will be payable (x) with respect to Notes represented by one or more Global Notes registered in the name of, or held by, the Depository or its nominee on the relevant record date, by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding Global Note by an amount equal to the amount of PIK Interest for the applicable interest period (rounded up to the nearest whole dollar) and (y) with respect to Notes not represented by Global Notes, by issuing Notes (rounded up to the nearest whole dollar) (“PIK Notes”), having the same terms and conditions as the Notes, in certificated form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the amount of PIK Interest for the applicable period, and the Trustee will, at the request of the Company, authenticate and deliver such PIK Notes for original issuance to applicable Holders on the relevant record date, as shown by the records of the register of Holders. Following an increase in the principal amount of the outstanding Global Notes as a result of a PIK Payment, the Global Notes will bear interest on such increased principal amount from and after the date of such PIK Payment. Any PIK Notes issued in certificated form will be dated as of the applicable interest payment date and will bear interest from and after such date.

(b) AMC shall ensure at all times that all shares of Common Stock to be issued and delivered upon exchange of Notes have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable, free of restrictions on transfer and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof (other than taxes payable by the Holder in respect of any issuance in a different name as specified in Section 10.10). (c) If on the relevant Exchange Date the Common Stock is listed on any U.S. national securities exchange or automated quotation system, the Common Stock to be issued upon exchange of the Notes shall be listed on such exchange or automated quotation system. (d) If any shares of Common Stock to be issued or delivered upon exchange of Notes hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares of Common Stock may be validly issued or delivered upon exchange, AMC has secured such registration or obtained such approval, as the case may be. (e) In no event shall the Company initiate a Soft Call if any Common Stock constituting “Registrable Securities” to be delivered by the Company pursuant to an exchange in connection therewith are unable to be sold pursuant to an effective registration statement pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement; provided that, the foregoing shall not apply with respect to Registrable Securities that are unable to be sold pursuant to an effective registration statement because the holder of such Registrable Securities has failed to provide on a timely basis information required to be included in such registration statement which the Company or AMC has reasonably requested in connection with the registration thereof."

The Trustee, the Company and the Guarantors hereby acknowledge and agree that the Notes Collateral Agent holds the Collateral in trust for the benefit of the Holders, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent and pursuant to the terms of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements. Each Holder, by accepting a Note, consents and agrees to the terms of the Security Documents (including the provisions providing for the possession, use, release and foreclosure of Collateral) and the Intercreditor Agreements as the same may be in effect or may be amended from time to time in accordance with their terms and this Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreements, and authorizes and directs the Notes Collateral Agent to enter into (or otherwise join, as applicable) the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements (including the Existing Restricted Group First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and the First Lien/Second Lien Centertainment Group Intercreditor Agreement on the Issue Date (and each other Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable, thereafter)) and to perform its obligations and exercise its rights thereunder in accordance therewith. In the event of conflict between an Intercreditor Agreement and any of the other Security Documents, the applicable Intercreditor Agreement shall control.
