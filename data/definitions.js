window.AMC_DEFINITIONS = {
  "consolidated ebitda": "A measure of AMC's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted with extensive add-backs including non-cash charges, stock compensation, restructuring costs, and pro forma adjustments for acquisitions/dispositions. This is the key metric used to calculate leverage ratios throughout the debt documents.",
  "total leverage ratio": "Total debt divided by Consolidated EBITDA. Used to determine interest rate grids (especially DOC 2) and covenant compliance. Currently ~12.47x at consolidated level.",
  "interest coverage ratio": "Consolidated EBITDA divided by total cash interest expense. Currently 0.83x - meaning AMC earns less than it owes in interest. Sub-1.0x at all entity levels signals severe distress.",
  "pik": "Payment-In-Kind. Instead of paying cash interest, the company adds the interest amount to the principal balance of the debt. This preserves near-term cash but grows the total debt pile over time.",
  "pik toggle": "A debt feature that gives the company the choice to pay interest in cash OR as PIK (added to principal) each period. DOC 7 allows 6% cash or 8% PIK at company's election.",
  "first lien": "The highest priority security interest on collateral. In a bankruptcy, first lien holders get paid first from the value of the pledged assets before any other creditors.",
  "second lien": "A security interest that is subordinate to the first lien. Second lien holders only recover from collateral after first lien claims are fully satisfied.",
  "1.25 lien": "An intermediate priority level between first and 1.5 lien. Used at the Muvico entity level for the DOC 5 Exchangeable Notes. Junior to the Term Loan but senior to other Muvico debt.",
  "1.5 lien": "An intermediate priority level between 1.25 lien and second lien. Used at the Muvico entity level for the DOC 2 PIK Notes. Junior to Term Loan and 1.25L but senior to 2L debt.",
  "unsecured": "Debt that is not backed by any specific collateral. Unsecured creditors only recover after all secured creditors are fully paid. The Odeon notes are secured by Odeon assets but unsecured at the AMC consolidated level.",
  "subordinated": "Debt that ranks below senior unsecured in the payment hierarchy. AMC's 6.125% notes (DOC 1) are subordinated AND have been covenant-stripped, making them the weakest position in the capital structure.",
  "exchange offer": "A transaction where existing debt holders are offered the opportunity to exchange their current notes for new notes with different terms. AMC used this mechanism in July 2020 to strip covenants from the 6.125% sub notes.",
  "supplemental indenture": "An amendment to an existing indenture (debt contract). Can be used to modify terms with sufficient holder consent. DOC 1 is a supplemental indenture that stripped protective covenants.",
  "indenture": "The legal contract governing a bond or note issuance. Specifies the terms including interest rate, maturity, covenants, events of default, and remedies. Each of AMC's debt tranches has its own indenture.",
  "trustee": "An independent third party (usually a bank) that represents bondholders' interests and enforces the terms of the indenture. Different trustees serve different tranches (U.S. Bank, GLAS Trust, CSC Delaware).",

  "unrestricted subsidiary": "A subsidiary that is carved out from the parent's indenture covenants. Muvico LLC was designated as an unrestricted subsidiary (the 'dropdown'), allowing new debt to be raised outside AMC's existing covenant restrictions.",
  "dropdown": "A liability management exercise where valuable assets are transferred to an unrestricted subsidiary, allowing new priority debt to be issued against those assets. AMC dropped 175 theaters + IP into Muvico LLC, disadvantaging existing creditors.",

  "covenant": "A legally binding promise in a debt agreement. Affirmative covenants require the borrower to do things (e.g., provide financial statements). Negative covenants restrict actions (e.g., limits on additional debt, asset sales, dividend payments).",
  "covenant strip": "The removal of protective covenants from an existing debt instrument, usually via a supplemental indenture with majority holder consent. DOC 1 stripped Sections 4.05-4.11 and Events of Default (e)-(j) from the 6.125% sub notes.",
