window.AMC_DEFINITIONS = {
  "consolidated ebitda": "A measure of AMC's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted with extensive add-backs including non-cash charges, stock compensation, restructuring costs, and pro forma adjustments for acquisitions/dispositions. This is the key metric used to calculate leverage ratios throughout the debt documents.",
  "total leverage ratio": "Total debt divided by Consolidated EBITDA. Used to determine interest rate grids (especially DOC 2) and covenant compliance. Currently ~12.47x at consolidated level.",
  "interest coverage ratio": "Consolidated EBITDA divided by total cash interest expense. Currently 0.83x - meaning AMC earns less than it owes in interest. Sub-1.0x at all entity levels signals severe distress.",
  "pik": "Payment-In-Kind. Instead of paying cash interest, the company adds the interest amount to the principal balance of the debt. This preserves near-term cash but grows the total debt pile over time.",
  "pik toggle": "A debt feature that gives the company the choice to pay interest in cash OR as PIK (added to principal) each period. DOC 7 allows 6% cash or 8% PIK at company's election.",
  "first lien": "The highest priority security interest on collateral. In a bankruptcy, first lien holders get paid first from the value of the pledged assets before any other creditors.",
  "second lien": "A security interest that is subordinate to the first lien. Second lien holders only recover from collateral after first lien claims are fully satisfied.",
