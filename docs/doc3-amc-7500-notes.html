<p><strong>Definitions and Rules of Construction.</strong> Establishes the defined terms, interpretive rules, Limited Condition Transaction provisions, and compliance determination mechanics for this indenture. As an AMC-issued instrument (not Muvico), the defined terms reflect AMC's direct obligations and the "Restricted Subsidiary" framework rather than the Muvico group structure used in DOC 2. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The definitions determine the scope of every covenant. Because this is an AMC-level instrument, terms like "Restricted Subsidiary" and "Unrestricted Subsidiary" apply at the AMC consolidated level, giving AMC more flexibility through subsidiary designation.</p>

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company has made an LCT Election and any of the ratios or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio or basket, including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the Company or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or action, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations; however, if any ratios improve or baskets increase as a result of such fluctuations, such improved ratios or baskets may be utilized. If the Company has made an LCT Election for any Limited Condition Transaction, then in connection with any subsequent calculation of the incurrence ratios subject to the LCT Election on or following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of (i) the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or (ii) the date that the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated or expires without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio or basket shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming such Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated.</div>

<p><strong>The Notes</strong> covers issuance mechanics, form, authentication, transfer, and interest computation. Unlike DOC 2 (which has PIK mechanics), these are straightforward fixed-rate cash-pay notes at 7.500%. The aggregate principal amount is unlimited, with Additional Notes issuable subject to covenant compliance. Interest is computed on a 360-day year. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The fixed-rate, cash-pay structure means AMC must actually pay 7.5% interest in cash every period, unlike Muvico's PIK notes where interest can compound as additional principal.</p>

Additional Notes may be issued without holder consent, subject to debt incurrence and lien covenants. All Notes form a single class for voting, amendments, and redemptions. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Additional issuance could dilute existing holders' recovery position unless constrained by the incurrence tests, which at AMC's current leverage levels are likely deeply restrictive.</p>

(c)            the issue price and issuance date of such Notes, including the date from which interest on such Notes shall accrue; and
(d)            if applicable, that such Notes shall be issuable in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Notes and, in such case, the respective depositories for such Global Notes, the form of any legend or legends that shall be borne by any such Global Notes in addition to or in lieu of that set forth in Appendix I to Exhibit A and any circumstances in addition to or in lieu of those set forth in Section 2.3 of Exhibit A in which any such Global Notes may be exchanged in whole or in part for Notes registered, and any transfer of such Global Notes in whole or in part may be registered, in the name or names of Persons other than the depository for such Global Note or a nominee thereof.
If any of the terms of any series are established by action taken pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officers’ Certificate or the trust indenture supplemental hereto setting forth the terms of the series.</div>

If an Officer whose signature is on a Note no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note, the Note shall be valid nevertheless.
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Additional Notes executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a written order of the Company in the form of an Officers’ Certificate for the authentication and delivery of such Notes, and the Trustee in accordance with such written order of the Company shall authenticate and deliver such Notes.
A Note shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the Note. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Note has been authenticated under this Indenture.
The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to authenticate the Notes. Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Notes whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as any Registrar, Paying Agent or agent for service of notices and demands.
The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Notes if the issue thereof will adversely affect the Trustee’s own rights, duties, indemnities or immunities under the Notes and this Indenture.</div>

Notice of any optional redemption upon any Equity Offering may be given prior to the completion of the related Equity Offering. Any redemption and notice of redemption may, at the Company’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, consummation of any related Equity Offering. In addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Company’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Company in its sole discretion), or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Company in its sole discretion) by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed. The Company may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Company’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.
The notice shall identify the Notes (or portion thereof) to be redeemed (including CUSIP numbers if any) and shall state:
(a)            the redemption date;
(b)            the redemption price;
(c)            the name and address of the Paying Agent;

(e)            if fewer than all the outstanding Notes are to be redeemed, or if a Note is to be redeemed in part only, the identification and principal amounts of the particular Notes (or portion thereof) to be redeemed;
(f)            that, unless the Company defaults in making such redemption payment or the Paying Agent is prohibited from making such payment pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, interest on Notes (or portion thereof) called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the redemption date;

<p><strong>Covenants</strong> for the AMC 7.5% Notes. These are direct AMC obligations (not Muvico), making the covenant package structurally different from DOC 2 and DOC 5. <strong>Critical structural point:</strong> These notes are 1L at AMC but only 2L at Muvico, meaning they are structurally disadvantaged compared to the Muvico-issued secured notes (DOC 2, DOC 4, DOC 5) when it comes to recovery on Muvico's theatre assets. This note trades at ~86.5 cents reflecting this structural subordination risk.</p>

<p><strong>Maintenance of Properties.</strong> AMC must keep all material property in good working order (ordinary wear and tear excepted), except where failure would not have a Material Adverse Effect. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> These notes have 1L security at the AMC level and 2L at Muvico, so property maintenance affects collateral value at both levels.</p>

<p><strong>Limitation on Indebtedness.</strong> AMC cannot incur additional Indebtedness unless the <strong>Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio</strong> (after pro forma effect) is at least 2.00:1.00. Permitted exceptions include refinancing debt, capital lease obligations, intercompany loans, and specific dollar-capped baskets. <strong>Compared to DOC 2:</strong> Same general structure, but because AMC is the direct issuer here, the incurrence test applies at the AMC consolidated level rather than just Muvico. Given AMC's 12.47x total leverage and 0.83x interest coverage, the general incurrence test is deeply restricted.</p>

<p><strong>Limitation on Restricted Payments.</strong> Prevents AMC from paying dividends, repurchasing stock, or making other distributions.

Exceptions include: payments up to the greater of $50M and a percentage of Total Assets, distributions from Unrestricted Subsidiaries, and certain permitted investments. <strong>Why it matters for AMC specifically:</strong> This is the primary protection preventing AMC from using cash flow to benefit equity holders while these notes trade at a discount to par.</p>

<p><strong>Limitation on Liens.</strong> AMC cannot create liens on its assets except for permitted liens. Since these notes have 1L priority at AMC, this covenant is critical to maintaining their senior secured position. Permitted liens include: existing liens, liens securing permitted refinancing debt, purchase money security interests, and general baskets. <strong>Key risk:</strong> The Muvico drop-down structure means theatre assets were moved to a subsidiary where these notes only have 2L priority, effectively circumventing this lien limitation at the asset level.</p>

Threshold requirements escalate with transaction size: Board resolution for transactions over $15 million, fairness opinion for transactions over $50 million. <strong>Critical context:</strong> The Muvico drop-down and intercompany arrangements (Alcohol Management Agreements, Management Services Agreement) are likely affiliate transactions that were structured to fall within the permitted baskets here.</p>

Exceptions include restrictions in other permitted debt documentation, existing restrictions, restrictions in sale agreements, customary lease provisions, restrictions on acquired subsidiaries, and ordinary course deposit restrictions. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> This prevents other creditors from contractually blocking these noteholders' security interests, but the extensive exceptions mean many common restrictions are permitted.</p>

<p><strong>Future Guarantors.</strong> After the Issue Date, any Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the Senior Credit Facilities or other debt exceeding $250M must also guarantee these Notes within 90 days. The new Guarantor must join the applicable Intercreditor Agreements and Security Documents. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The $250M threshold is higher than DOC 2's $150M threshold and the 90-day period is longer than DOC 2's 30 days, reflecting the structural seniority differences between the two instruments. This means some subsidiaries that guarantee DOC 2 may not be required to guarantee DOC 3.</p>

<p><strong>Change of Control.</strong> If a Change of Control occurs (defined as acquisition of 40%+ voting stock, or certain board changes), the Company must offer to repurchase all notes at <strong>101% of principal plus accrued interest</strong>. This is a standard high-yield put right that protects holders against an acquirer loading up the company with additional debt. <strong>Compared to other docs:</strong> DOC 2 and DOC 5 do NOT have a Change of Control put, making this provision unique to the AMC-level notes.</p>

              <div class="legal-text">Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, unless the Company has previously or concurrently delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under Section 3.03, the Company will be required to make an offer (a “Change of Control Offer”) to purchase all outstanding Notes (as described in this Indenture) at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount (or such higher amount as the Company may determine (any Change of Control Offer at a higher amount, an “Alternate Offer”)) (such price, the “Change of Control Payment”) plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).
Within 60 days following the date upon which the Change of Control occurred, the Company must send, electronically or by first class mail to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of the Depository, a notice to each Holder of Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, which notice shall govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer. Such notice will state:
(1)            that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Company;
(2)            the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 20 Business Days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); provided, that the Change of Control Payment Date shall be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date such notice is sent) as any or all such conditions referred to in clause (8) below shall be satisfied or waived;
(3)            that any Notes not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;
(4)            that unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment plus accrued and unpaid interest on all properly tendered Notes, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date;
(5)            that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;
(6)            until the close of business on the tenth Business Day after the date such notice is sent (or such later time and date as the Company may decide in its sole discretion) (such time and date, the “withdrawal deadline”), that Holders shall be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Company to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the withdrawal deadline, as electronic transmission (in PDF), a facsimile transmission or letter or other communication in accordance with the procedures of DTC setting forth the name of the Holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased;
(7)            that if less than all of such Holder’s Notes are tendered for purchase, such Holder will be issued new Notes (or, in the case of Global Notes, such Notes shall be reduced by such amount of Notes that the Holder has tendered) and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered (the unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof);
(8)            if such notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control or such other conditions specified therein and describing each such condition, and, if applicable, stating that, in the Company’s discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the notice is mailed or delivered) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or that such purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that the Company reasonably believes that any or all such conditions (including the occurrence of such Change of Control) will not be satisfied or waived by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed; and
(9)           such other instructions, as determined by the Company, consistent with this Section 4.11, that a Holder must follow.
If a notice relating to a Change of Control Offer that is subject to one or more conditions precedent (other than the occurrence of a Change of Control) is later rescinded as described in clause (8) above as a result of the failure of such condition(s) to be satisfied or waived (or as a result of the Company reasonably believing that such will be the case), the offer described in such notice will not be deemed a valid “Change of Control Offer” for purposes of this Section 4.11.
The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party approved in writing by the Company makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer, (ii) a notice of redemption to the Holders of the Notes has been given pursuant to this Indenture pursuant to Section 3.03 herein or (iii) in the event that upon the consummation of such Change of Control, the Company defeases or discharges the Notes as provided for under Article Eight herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer.
If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Company, or any third party approved in writing by the Company making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Company as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice (except that such notice may be delivered or mailed more than 60 days prior to the redemption date or purchase date if the notice is subject to one or more conditions precedent as described therein and such date is delayed until such time as any and all such conditions are satisfied or waived), given not more than 60 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem (with respect to the Company) or purchase (with respect to a third party) all of the Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase on a date (the “Second Change of Control Payment Date”) at a price in cash equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of the Second Change of Control Payment Date, including, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the Second Change of Control Payment Date, subject to the right of Holders of record of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Second Change of Control Payment Date.
If an offer is made to repurchase the Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer pursuant to this covenant, the Company will comply with all tender offer rules under state and federal securities laws, including, but not limited to, Section 14(e) under the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-1 thereunder, to the extent applicable to such offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Section 14(e) of, and Rule 14e-1 under, the Exchange Act, conflict with the change of control provisions of this Indenture, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the change of control provisions of this Indenture by virtue of such compliance.
A Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of this Indenture, the Notes and/or the Subsidiary Guarantees so long as the tender of Notes by a Holder is not conditioned upon the delivery of consents by such Holder. In addition, the Company or any third party approved in writing by the Company that is making the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may, subject to applicable law, increase or decrease the Change of Control Payment (or decline to pay any early tender or similar premium) being offered to Holders at any time in its sole discretion, so long as the Change of Control Payment is at least equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.</div>

Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion), and in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of Excess Proceeds.

(e)            Notwithstanding anything in this Indenture to the contrary, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Applicable Proceeds received by a Foreign Subsidiary are prohibited or delayed under any Requirements of Law from being repatriated to the Company, the portion of such Applicable Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this Section 4.16 and shall not constitute Excess Proceeds and may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the applicable Requirement of Law will not permit repatriation to the Company (the Company hereby agreeing to cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable Requirement of Law to permit such repatriation), and once such repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds is permitted under the applicable Requirement of Law, such repatriation will be promptly effected and such repatriated Applicable Proceeds will be promptly applied (net of additional taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) in compliance with this Section 4.16, and (ii) to the extent that and for so long as the Company has determined in good faith that repatriation of any of or all the Applicable Proceeds would have a material adverse tax consequence (taking into account any foreign tax credit or benefit actually realized in connection with such repatriation), the Applicable Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this Section 4.16 and shall not constitute Excess Proceeds and may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary; provided that when the Company determines in good faith that repatriation of any of or all the Applicable Proceeds received by a Foreign Subsidiary would no longer have a material adverse tax consequence (taking into account any foreign tax credit or benefit actually realized in connection with such repatriation), such Applicable Proceeds shall be promptly applied (net of additional taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) in compliance with this Section 4.16.
(f)            For purposes of clause 4.16(a)(2) of this Section 4.16 (and no other provision), the following shall be deemed to be cash or Cash Equivalents:
(1)            the greater of the principal amount and carrying value of any liabilities (as reflected on the most recent balance sheet of the Company (or a Parent Entity) provided hereunder or in the footnotes thereto), or if incurred, accrued or increased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on the balance sheet of the Company ((or Parent Entity) or in the footnotes thereto) if such incurrence, accrual or increase had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined in good faith by the Company of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Secured Notes Obligations, that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets (or are otherwise extinguished in connection with the transactions relating to such Asset Sale) pursuant to a written agreement which releases the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from such liabilities;
(2)            any securities received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received) within 180 days following the closing of the applicable Asset Sale; and
(3)            any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary in respect of such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (3) that is at that time outstanding, not in excess (at the time of receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration) of 5% of Consolidated Total Assets for the most recently ended Test Period as of the time of receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration, with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value.
(g)            The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the asset sale provisions of this Indenture, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the asset sale provisions of this Indenture by virtue of such compliance.
(h)            The provisions of this Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. An Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of this Indenture, the Notes and/or the Subsidiary Guarantees so long as the tender of the Notes by a Holder is not conditioned upon the delivery of consents by such Holder.</div>

<p><strong>Acceleration; Rescission and Annulment.</strong> Upon an Event of Default (other than bankruptcy), holders of at least 30% or the Trustee may declare all notes immediately due.

<p><strong>Compensation and Indemnity.</strong> AMC must pay Trustee compensation, reimburse documented expenses, and indemnify against losses (except for willful misconduct or negligence).

The Trustee’s compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for all documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred or made by it, including costs of collection, in addition to the compensation for its services. Such expenses shall include the documented compensation and expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee’s agents, counsel, accountants and experts. The Company shall indemnify the Trustee against any and all loss, liability or expense (including documented attorneys’ fees) incurred by it in connection with the acceptance and administration of this trust and the performance of its duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not reimburse any expenses or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee’s own willful misconduct, negligence or bad faith. The Company need not pay for any settlement made by the Trustee without the Company’s consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. All indemnifications and releases from liability granted hereunder to the Trustee shall extend to its officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns.
To secure the Company’s payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Notes on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee other than money or property held in trust to pay principal of and interest on particular Notes.
The Company’s payment obligations pursuant to this Section shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and the discharge of this Indenture. When the Trustee incurs expenses after the occurrence of a Default specified in Section 6.01(e) or (f) with respect to the Company, the expenses are intended to constitute expenses of administration under the Bankruptcy Law.

A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07.

<p><strong>Discharge and Defeasance</strong> provides mechanisms for AMC to terminate obligations. Satisfaction and discharge occurs upon full payment or cancellation. Legal defeasance releases all obligations; covenant defeasance releases only certain covenants. Both require deposit of sufficient cash or Government Securities with the Trustee. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Defeasance is extremely unlikely for a company with AMC's leverage profile, as it requires depositing enough risk-free assets to pay all future principal and interest.</p>

<p><strong>Discharge of Liability on Notes; Defeasance.</strong> The indenture is discharged when all notes are canceled or the Company deposits sufficient cash/Government Securities. Legal defeasance releases all obligations and collateral liens. Covenant defeasance releases Sections 4.03-4.13, 4.16-4.17, and parts of Section 5.01. Certain obligations (Sections 2.03-2.09, 4.01, 7.07, 7.08, 8.03-8.06) survive until full payment. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Legal defeasance makes the notes effectively risk-free by substituting government securities, while covenant defeasance preserves the notes but frees AMC from restrictions.</p>

<p><strong>Conditions to Defeasance.</strong> Requirements include: irrevocable deposit with the Trustee, IRS ruling or tax law change opinion for legal defeasance, no-adverse-tax opinion for covenant defeasance, no existing defaults, and Officer's Certificate plus Opinion of Counsel. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The IRS ruling requirement for legal defeasance is a very high bar, making it practically impossible absent specific tax law changes.</p>

Such record date shall be a date not more than 30 days prior to the first solicitation of Holders generally in connection therewith and no later than the date such solicitation is completed. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to give such consent or to revoke any consent previously given or to take any such action, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 180 days after such record date.
For all purposes of this Indenture, all Initial Notes and Additional Notes shall vote together as one series of Notes under this Indenture.</div>

<p><strong>Subsidiary Guarantee</strong> establishes the framework for subsidiary guarantees. Each Guarantor fully, unconditionally, and irrevocably guarantees all payment obligations on a joint and several basis.

<p><strong>Subsidiary Guarantee.</strong> Each Guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees all payment obligations, jointly and severally, as a guarantee of payment. The guarantee survives extensions, modifications, and waivers of the underlying obligations. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Joint and several liability means any single Guarantor can be held responsible for the entire $360M outstanding. This is a direct AMC obligation, so the guarantee structure adds subsidiary-level claims.</p>

              <div class="legal-text">Subject to the provisions of this Article Eleven, each Guarantor hereby fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, jointly and severally with each other Guarantor, to each Holder of the Notes and the Trustee, the full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and all other obligations and liabilities of the Company under this Indenture and the Notes (including, without limitation, any interest, fees or expenses accruing subsequent to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, whether or not such interest, fees or expenses is an allowed claim under applicable state, federal or foreign law and the obligations under Section 7.07) (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the “Guarantor Obligations”). Each Guarantor agrees that the Guarantor Obligations will rank equally in right of payment with other indebtedness of such Guarantor, except to the extent such other Indebtedness is subordinate to the Guarantor Obligations. Each Guarantor further agrees (to the extent permitted by law) that the Guarantor Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound under this Article Eleven notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guarantor Obligation.
Each Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of payment from and protest to the Company of any of the Guarantor Obligations and also waives notice of protest for non-payment. Each Guarantor waives notice of any default under the Notes or the Guarantor Obligations.
Each Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (and not a guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder to any security held for payment of the Guarantor Obligations.
Except as set forth in Section 11.02, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than payment of the Guarantor Obligations in full), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guarantor Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by (a) the failure of any Holder to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Company or any other person under, this Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal granted; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement; (d) the release of any security held by any Holder or the Trustee for the Guarantor Obligations or any of them; (e) the failure of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy against any other Guarantor; (f) any change in the ownership of the Company; (g) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guarantor Obligations; or (h) any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of such Guarantor as a matter of law or equity.
Subject to the provisions of Section 4.10, each Guarantor agrees that its Subsidiary Guarantee herein shall remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the Guarantor Obligations or such Guarantor is released from its Subsidiary Guarantee in compliance with Section 11.03 hereof. Each Guarantor further agrees that its Subsidiary Guarantee herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any of the Guarantor Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise.
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay any of the Guarantor Obligations when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Holders an amount equal to the sum of (i) the unpaid amount of such Guarantor Obligations then due and owing and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest on such Guarantor Obligations then due and owing (but only to the extent not prohibited by law).
Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between such Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the Guarantor Obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in this Indenture for the purposes of its Guarantee herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Guarantor Obligations guaranteed hereby and (y) in the event of any such declaration of acceleration of such Guarantor Obligations, such Guarantor Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantor for the purposes of this Subsidiary Guarantee.
Each Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee or the Holders in enforcing any rights under this Section.</div>

<p><strong>Collateral</strong> governs the security interests backing these notes. These notes have a dual priority structure: 1L at AMC (pari passu with the Term Loan on AMC-level assets) but only 2L at Muvico (junior to the Term Loan, Exchangeable Notes, and Muvico PIK Notes on Muvico's theatre assets). The Notes Collateral Agent holds collateral in trust for holders. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The 2L position at Muvico is the key structural weakness -- most of the valuable operating assets (theatres) are at Muvico, where these notes are subordinated to ~$3.7B of senior claims.</p>

The Company and the Guarantors shall, at their sole expense, take all actions and make all filings (including filing Uniform Commercial Code (including amendments and continuation statements) and other financing statements, mortgages and deeds of trust) that may be required under applicable law, or that the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent may reasonably request, in order to ensure the creation, perfection and priority (or continuance thereof), as security for the Obligations of Company and the Guarantors to the secured parties under this Indenture, the Notes, the Subsidiary Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents, of a valid and enforceable perfected Lien and security interest in and on all of the Collateral (subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents), in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Holders and the Trustee subject to no Liens other than Permitted Liens.
(b)            It is understood and agreed that prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations that are Credit Agreement Obligations, to the extent that the First Lien Collateral Agent is satisfied with or agrees to any deliveries or documents required to be provided in respect of any matters relating to the Collateral or makes any determination in respect of any matters relating to the Collateral (including, without limitation, extensions of time or waivers for the creation and perfection of security interests in, or the obtaining of title insurance, surveys, legal opinions or other deliverables with respect to, particular assets or the provision of any guarantee by any Subsidiary (including in connection with assets acquired, or Subsidiaries formed or acquired, after the Issue Date) where it determines that such action cannot be accomplished without undue effort or expense by the time or times at which it would otherwise be required to be accomplished by the Senior Credit Facilities), the Notes Collateral Agent shall be deemed to be satisfied with such deliveries and/or documents and the judgment of the First Lien Collateral Agent in respect of any such matters under the Senior Credit Facilities shall be deemed to be the judgment of the Notes Collateral Agent in respect of such matters under this Indenture and the Security Documents.</div>

<p><strong>Release of Collateral.</strong> Collateral is automatically released upon: permitted dispositions, Guarantor release, subsidiary dissolution, conversion to Excluded Asset, or enforcement by the senior collateral agent under the Intercreditor Agreement. All liens terminate upon full payment, discharge, or as provided in the Intercreditor Agreements. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The senior collateral agent's ability to release collateral during enforcement without these 2L holders' consent at Muvico is a significant risk factor.</p>

The Notes Collateral Agent agrees to act as such on the express conditions contained in this Section 12.08. Each Holder agrees that any action taken by the Notes Collateral Agent in accordance with the provision of this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents, and the exercise by the Notes Collateral Agent of any rights or remedies set forth herein and therein shall be authorized and binding upon all Holders. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements, the duties of the Notes Collateral Agent shall be ministerial and administrative in nature, and the Notes Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein and in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements to which the Notes Collateral Agent is a party, nor shall the Notes Collateral Agent have or be deemed to have any trust or other fiduciary relationship with the Trustee, any Holder or any Grantor, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements or otherwise exist against the Notes Collateral Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term “agent” in this Indenture with reference to the Notes Collateral Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.
(b)            The Notes Collateral Agent may perform any of its duties under this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements by or through receivers, agents, employees, attorneys-in-fact or with respect to any specified Person, such Person’s Affiliates, and the respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and attorneys-in-fact of such Person and its Affiliates (a “Related Person”), and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties, and shall be entitled to act upon, and shall be fully protected in taking action in reliance upon any advice or opinion given by legal counsel. The Notes Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any receiver, agent, employee, attorney-in-fact or Related Person that it selects as long as such selection was made in good faith and with due care.
(c)            None of the Notes Collateral Agent or any of its respective Related Persons shall (i) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Indenture or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or under or in connection with any Security Document or the Intercreditor Agreements or the transactions contemplated thereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of the Trustee or any Holder for any recital, statement, representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company or any other Grantor or Affiliate of any Grantor, or any Officer or Related Person thereof, contained in this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Notes Collateral Agent under or in connection with, this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements, or for any failure of any Grantor or any other party to this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. None of the Notes Collateral Agent or any of its respective Related Persons shall be under any obligation to the Trustee or any Holder to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements or to inspect the properties, books, or records of any Grantor or any Grantor’s Affiliates.
(d)            The Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, certification, telephone message, statement, or other communication, document or conversation (including those by telephone or e-mail) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent, or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to the Company or any other Grantor), independent accountants and other experts and advisors selected by the Notes Collateral Agent. The Notes Collateral Agent shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, or other paper or document. The Notes Collateral Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Trustee or the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes as it determines and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Holders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Notes Collateral Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements in accordance with a request, direction, instruction or consent of the Trustee or the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Holders.
(e)            The Notes Collateral Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, unless a Responsible Officer of the Notes Collateral Agent shall have received written notice from the Trustee or the Company referring to this Indenture, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default.” The Notes Collateral Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be requested by the Trustee in accordance with Article 6 or the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes (subject to this Section 12.08).
(f)             The Notes Collateral Agent may resign at any time by notice to the Trustee and the Company, such resignation to be effective upon the acceptance of a successor agent to its appointment as Notes Collateral Agent. If the Notes Collateral Agent resigns under this Indenture, the Company shall appoint a successor collateral agent. If no successor collateral agent is appointed prior to the intended effective date of the resignation of the Notes Collateral Agent (as stated in the notice of resignation), the Trustee, at the direction of the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, may appoint a successor collateral agent, subject to the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and which shall not be required during a continuing Event of Default). If no successor collateral agent is appointed and consented to by the Company pursuant to the preceding sentence within thirty (30) days after the intended effective date of resignation (as stated in the notice of resignation) the Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor collateral agent hereunder, such successor collateral agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Notes Collateral Agent, and the term “Notes Collateral Agent” shall mean such successor collateral agent, and the retiring Notes Collateral Agent’s appointment, powers and duties as the Notes Collateral Agent shall be terminated. After the retiring Notes Collateral Agent’s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Section 12.08 shall continue to inure to its benefit and the retiring Notes Collateral Agent shall not by reason of such resignation be deemed to be released from liability as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Notes Collateral Agent under this Indenture.
(g)            The Trustee shall initially act as Notes Collateral Agent and shall be authorized to appoint co-Notes Collateral Agents as necessary in its sole discretion. Except as otherwise explicitly provided herein or in the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements, neither the Notes Collateral Agent nor any of its respective officers, directors, employees or agents or other Related Persons shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part thereof. The Notes Collateral Agent shall be accountable only for amounts that it actually receives as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither the Notes Collateral Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
(h)            The Notes Collateral Agent is authorized and directed to (i) enter into the Security Documents to which it is party, whether executed on or after the Issue Date, (ii) enter into the Intercreditor Agreements, including joinders and supplements thereto, whether executed on or after the Issue Date, (iii) make the representations of the Holders set forth in the Security Documents and Intercreditor Agreements, (iv) bind the Holders on the terms as set forth in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements and (v) perform and observe its obligations under the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements.
(i)            If at any time or times the Trustee shall receive (i) by payment, foreclosure, set-off or otherwise, any proceeds of Collateral or any payments with respect to the Obligations arising under, or relating to, this Indenture, except for any such proceeds or payments received by the Trustee from the Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, or (ii) payments from the Notes Collateral Agent in excess of the amount required to be paid to the Trustee pursuant to Article 6, the Trustee shall promptly turn the same over to the Notes Collateral Agent, in kind, and with such endorsements as may be required to negotiate the same to the Notes Collateral Agent such proceeds to be applied by the Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements.
(j)            The Notes Collateral Agent is each Holder’s agent for the purpose of perfecting the Holders’ security interest in assets which, in accordance with Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code can be perfected only by possession. Should the Trustee obtain possession of any such Collateral, upon request from the Company, the Trustee shall notify the Notes Collateral Agent thereof and promptly shall deliver such Collateral to the Notes Collateral Agent or otherwise deal with such Collateral in accordance with the Notes Collateral Agent’s instructions.
(k)            The Notes Collateral Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to the Trustee or any of the Holders to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by any Grantor or is cared for, protected, or insured or has been encumbered, or that the Notes Collateral Agent’s Liens have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected, maintained or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to determine whether all of the Grantor’s property constituting Collateral intended to be subject to the Lien and security interest of the Security Documents has been properly and completely listed or delivered, as the case may be, or the genuineness, validity, marketability or sufficiency thereof or title thereto, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities, and powers granted or available to the Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to this Indenture, any Security Document or the Intercreditor Agreements other than pursuant to the instructions of the Trustee or the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes or as otherwise provided in the Security Documents.
(l)            If the Company or any Guarantor (i) incurs any obligations in respect of junior priority obligations at any time when no First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement is in effect and (ii) delivers to the Notes Collateral Agent an Officers’ Certificate so stating and requesting the Notes Collateral Agent to enter into the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement in favor of a designated agent or representative for the holders of the junior priority obligations so incurred, the Notes Collateral Agent shall (and is hereby authorized and directed to) enter into such intercreditor agreement (at the sole expense and cost of the Company, including legal fees and expenses of the Notes Collateral Agent), bind the Holders on the terms set forth therein and perform and observe its obligations thereunder; provided that neither an Officer’s Certificate nor an Opinion of Counsel shall be required pursuant to this Section 12.08(l) in connection with the applicable Intercreditor Agreements (including pursuant to a joinder thereto) to be entered into.
(m)            No provision of this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements or any Security Document shall require the Notes Collateral Agent (or the Trustee) to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or thereunder or to take or omit to take any action hereunder or thereunder or take any action at the request or direction of Holders (or the Trustee in the case of the Notes Collateral Agent) unless it shall have received indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Notes Collateral Agent and the Trustee against potential costs and liabilities incurred by the Notes Collateral Agent relating thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements or the Security Documents, in the event the Notes Collateral Agent is entitled or required to commence an action to foreclose or otherwise exercise its remedies to acquire control or possession of the Collateral, the Notes Collateral Agent shall not be required to commence any such action or exercise any remedy or to inspect or conduct any studies of any property under the mortgages or take any such other action if the Notes Collateral Agent has determined that the Notes Collateral Agent may incur personal liability as a result of the presence at, or release on or from, the Collateral or such property, of any hazardous substances. The Notes Collateral Agent shall at any time be entitled to cease taking any action described in this clause if it no longer reasonably deems any indemnity, security or undertaking from the Company or the Holders to be sufficient.
(n)            The Notes Collateral Agent (i) shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in connection with this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents or instrument referred to herein or therein, except to the extent that any of the foregoing are found by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its own gross negligence or willful misconduct, (ii) shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Notes Collateral Agent may agree in writing with the Company (and money held in trust by the Notes Collateral Agent need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law) and (iii) may consult with counsel of its selection and the advice or opinion of such counsel as to matters of law shall be full and complete authorization and protection from liability in respect of any action taken, omitted or suffered by it in good faith and in accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel. The grant of permissive rights or powers to the Notes Collateral Agent shall not be construed to impose duties to act.
(o)            Neither the Notes Collateral Agent nor the Trustee shall be liable for delays or failures in performance resulting from acts beyond its control. Such acts shall include but not be limited to acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war, epidemics, governmental regulations superimposed after the fact, fire, communication line failures, computer viruses, power failures, earthquakes or other disasters. Neither the Notes Collateral Agent nor the Trustee shall be liable for any indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages (included but not limited to lost profits) whatsoever, even if it has been informed of the likelihood thereof and regardless of the form of action.
(p)            The Notes Collateral Agent does not assume any responsibility for any failure or delay in performance or any breach by the Company or any other Grantor under this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents. The Notes Collateral Agent shall not be responsible to the Holders or any other Person for any recitals, statements, information, representations or warranties contained in this Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreements or in any certificate, report, statement, or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Notes Collateral Agent under or in connection with, this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements or any Security Document; the execution, validity, genuineness, effectiveness or enforceability of the Intercreditor Agreements and any Security Documents of any other party thereto; the genuineness, enforceability, collectability, value, sufficiency, location or existence of any Collateral, or the validity, effectiveness, enforceability, sufficiency, extent, perfection or priority of any Lien therein; the validity, enforceability or collectability of any Obligations; the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, business, creditworthiness or legal status of any obligor; or for any failure of any obligor to perform its Obligations under this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents. The Notes Collateral Agent shall have no obligation to any Holder or any other Person to ascertain or inquire into the existence of any Default or Event of Default, the observance or performance by any obligor of any terms of this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents, or the satisfaction of any conditions precedent contained in this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements and any Security Documents. The Notes Collateral Agent shall not be required to initiate or conduct any litigation or collection or other proceeding under this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents unless expressly set forth hereunder or thereunder. The Notes Collateral Agent shall have the right at any time to seek instructions from the Holders with respect to the administration of this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements.
(q)            The parties hereto and the Holders hereby agree and acknowledge that neither the Notes Collateral Agent nor the Trustee shall assume, be responsible for or otherwise be obligated for any liabilities, claims, causes of action, suits, losses, allegations, requests, demands, penalties, fines, settlements, damages (including foreseeable and unforeseeable), judgments, expenses and costs (including but not limited to, any remediation, corrective action, response, removal or remedial action, or investigation, operations and maintenance or monitoring costs, for personal injury or property damages, real or personal) of any kind whatsoever, pursuant to any environmental law as a result of this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements, the Security Documents or any actions taken pursuant hereto or thereto. Further, the parties hereto and the Holders hereby agree and acknowledge that in the exercise of its rights under this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents, the Notes Collateral Agent may hold or obtain indicia of ownership primarily to protect the security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent in the Collateral and that any such actions taken by the Notes Collateral Agent shall not be construed as or otherwise constitute any participation in the management of such Collateral. In the event that the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee is required to acquire title to an asset for any reason, or take any managerial action of any kind in regard thereto, in order to carry out any fiduciary or trust obligation for the benefit of another, which in the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee’s sole discretion may cause the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee to be considered an “owner or operator” under the provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), 42 U.S.C. §9601, et seq., or otherwise cause the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee to incur liability under CERCLA or any other federal, state or local law, the Notes Collateral Agent and the Trustee reserves the right, instead of taking such action, to either resign as the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee or arrange for the transfer of the title or control of the asset to a court-appointed receiver. Neither the Notes Collateral Agent nor the Trustee shall be liable to the Company, the Guarantors or any other Person for any environmental claims or contribution actions under any federal, state or local law, rule or regulation by reason of the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee’s actions and conduct as authorized, empowered and directed hereunder or relating to the discharge, release or threatened release of hazardous materials into the environment. If at any time it is necessary or advisable for property to be possessed, owned, operated or managed by any Person (including the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee) other than the Company or the Guarantors, a majority in interest of Holders shall direct the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee to appoint an appropriately qualified Person (excluding the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee) who they shall designate to possess, own, operate or manage, as the case may be, the property.
(r)            Upon the receipt by the Notes Collateral Agent of a written request of the Company signed by an Officer (a “Security Document Order”), the Notes Collateral Agent is hereby authorized to execute and enter into, and shall execute and enter into, without the further consent of any Holder or the Trustee, any Security Document or amendment or supplement thereto, to be executed after the Issue Date. Such Security Document Order shall (i) state that it is being delivered to the Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to, and is a Security Document Order referred to in, this Section 12.08(r), and (ii) instruct the Notes Collateral Agent to execute and enter into such Security Document or amendment or supplement thereto. Any such execution of a Security Document or amendment or supplement thereto shall be at the direction and expense of the Company, upon delivery to the Notes Collateral Agent of an Officer’s Certificate stating that all conditions precedent to the execution and delivery of the Security Document or amendment or supplement thereto have been satisfied. The Holders, by their acceptance of the Notes, hereby authorize and direct the Notes Collateral Agent to execute such Security Documents or amendment or supplement thereto.
(s)            Subject to the provisions of the applicable Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements, each Holder, by acceptance of the Notes, agrees that the Notes Collateral Agent shall execute and deliver the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents to which it is a party and all agreements, documents and instruments incidental thereto, and act in accordance with the terms thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the Notes Collateral Agent shall have no discretion under this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements or the Security Documents and shall not be required to make or give any determination, consent, approval, request or direction without the written direction of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes or the Trustee, as applicable.
(t)            After the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee, acting at the direction of the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, may direct the Notes Collateral Agent in connection with any action required or permitted by this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements.
(u)            The Notes Collateral Agent is authorized to receive any funds for the benefit of itself, the Trustee and the Holders distributed under the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements and to the extent not prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreements, for turnover to the Trustee to make further distributions of such funds to itself, the Trustee and the Holders in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.10 and the other provisions of this Indenture.
(v)            In each case that the Notes Collateral Agent may or is required hereunder or under any Security Document or any Intercreditor Agreement to take any action (an “Action”), including without limitation to make any determination, to give consents, to exercise rights, powers or remedies, to release or sell Collateral or otherwise to act hereunder or under any Security Document or any Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes Collateral Agent may seek direction from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes. The Notes Collateral Agent shall not be liable with respect to any Action taken or omitted to be taken by it in accordance with the direction from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes. If the Notes Collateral Agent shall request direction from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes with respect to any Action, the Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such Action unless and until the Notes Collateral Agent shall have received direction from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, and the Notes Collateral Agent shall not incur liability to any Person by reason of so refraining.
(w)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture or in any Security Document or any Intercreditor Agreement, in no event shall the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee be responsible for, or have any duty or obligation with respect to, the recording, filing, registering, perfection, protection or maintenance of the security interests or Liens intended to be created by this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements (including without limitation the filing or continuation of any UCC financing or continuation statements or similar documents or instruments), nor shall the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee be responsible for, and neither the Notes Collateral Agent nor the Trustee makes any representation regarding, the validity, effectiveness or priority of any of the Security Documents or the security interests or Liens intended to be created thereby.
(x)            Before the Notes Collateral Agent acts or refrains from acting in each case at the request or direction of the Company or the Guarantors, it may require an Officer’s Certificate, which shall conform to the provisions of this Section 12.08 and Sections 13.04 and 13.05; provided that no Officer’s Certificate shall be required in connection with the Security Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement to be entered by the Notes Collateral Agent on the Issue Date. The Notes Collateral Agent shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on such certificate.
(y)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Notes Collateral Agent shall act pursuant to the instructions of the Holders and the Trustee solely with respect to the Security Documents and the Collateral.
(z)            The rights, privileges, benefits, immunities, indemnities and other protections given to the Trustee are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Notes Collateral Agent as if the Notes Collateral Agent were named as the Trustee herein and the Security Documents were named as this Indenture herein.
(aa)      The Company and the Guarantors shall furnish to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (beginning with the first fiscal year ending after the Issue Date and after giving effect to any fiscal year end change effected on or after the Issue Date), an Officer’s Certificate (which may be the same certificate required to be delivered by the Company pursuant to Section 4.13) either (i) (x) stating that such action has been taken with respect to the recording, filing, re-recording, and refiling of this Indenture or the Security Documents, as applicable, as are necessary to maintain the perfected Liens of the applicable Security Documents securing the Obligations under applicable law to the extent required by the Security Documents other than any action as described therein to be taken, and (y) stating that on the date of such Officer’s Certificate, all financing statements, financing statement amendments and continuation statements have been or will be executed and filed that are necessary, as of such date or promptly thereafter and during the succeeding 12 months, fully to maintain the perfection (to the extent required by the Security Documents) of the security interests of the Notes Collateral Agent securing the Obligations thereunder and under the Security Documents with respect to the Collateral; provided that if there is a required filing of a continuation statement or other instrument within such 12-month period and such continuation statement or amendment is not effective if filed at the time of the Officer’s Certificate, such Officer’s Certificate may so state and in that case the Company and the Guarantors shall cause a continuation statement or amendment to be timely filed and become effective so as to maintain such Liens and security interests securing Obligations or (ii) stating that no such action is necessary to maintain such Liens or security interests.</div>

(i)            certification (in the form set forth on the reverse side of the Initial Note) that such Definitive Note is being transferred (1) to a QIB in accordance with Rule 144A or (2) outside the United States in an offshore transaction within the meaning of Regulation S and in compliance with Rule 904 under the Securities Act, which certification shall be accompanied by a signed letter substantially in the form of Exhibit B; and
(ii)            written instructions directing the Trustee to make, or to direct the Securities Custodian to make, an adjustment on its books and records with respect to such Global Note to reflect an increase in the aggregate principal amount of the Note represented by the Global Note, such instructions to contain information regarding the Depository to be credited with such increase,

If no Global Notes are then outstanding and the Global Note has not been previously exchanged for certificated securities pursuant to Section 2.4, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate, upon written order of the Company in the form of an Officers’ Certificate, a new Global Note in the appropriate principal amount.

(i)            The transfer and exchange of Global Notes or beneficial interests therein shall be effected through the Depository in accordance with this Indenture (including applicable restrictions on transfer set forth herein, if any) and the procedures of the Depository therefor. A transferor of a beneficial interest in a Global Note shall deliver a written order given in accordance with the procedures of the Depository containing information regarding the participant account of the Depository to be credited with a beneficial interest in the Global Note and such account shall be credited in accordance with such instructions with a beneficial interest in the Global Note and the account of the Person making the transfer shall be debited by an amount equal to the beneficial interest in the Global Note being transferred.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind any declaration of acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree, and if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except non-payment of principal or interest that has become due solely because of the acceleration.
16.            Security.
The Notes will be secured by the Collateral on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Indenture and the Security Documents. The Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as the case may be, hold the Collateral in trust for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, in each case pursuant to the Security Documents. Each Holder, by accepting this Note, consents and agrees to the terms of the Security Documents (including the provisions providing for the foreclosure and release of Collateral) as the same may be in effect or may be amended from time to time in accordance with their terms and the Indenture and authorizes and directs the Notes Collateral Agent to enter into the Security Documents on the Issue Date, and at any time after Issue Date, as applicable, and to perform its obligations and exercise its rights thereunder in accordance therewith.
17.           Trustee Dealings with the Company
Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
A-19
18.            No Recourse Against Others
A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Note, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Notes.

FORM OF SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE TO ADD GUARANTORS
This Supplemental Indenture, dated as of [______], 20 (this “Supplemental Indenture”) among [name of future Guarantor] (the “Subsidiary Guarantor”), a subsidiary of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (together with its successors and assigns, the “Company”) and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent under the Indenture referred to below.
W I T N E S S E T H:
WHEREAS, the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent have heretofore executed and delivered an Indenture, dated as of February 14, 2022 (as amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified, the “Indenture”) providing for the issuance of 7.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 of the Company (the “Notes”);
WHEREAS, Section 4.10 of the Indenture provides that under certain circumstances the Subsidiary Guarantor shall execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Subsidiary Guarantor will unconditionally Guarantee, on a joint and several basis with the other Guarantors, the full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and all other obligations and liabilities of the Company under this
Indenture on the terms and conditions set forth herein and under the Indenture (the “Subsidiary Guarantee”); and
WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 9.01 of the Indenture, the Trustee, the Company and the Guarantors are authorized to execute and deliver this Supplemental Indenture to amend or supplement the Indenture, without the consent of any Holder;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Subsidiary Guarantor, the Company, the other Guarantors and the Trustee mutually covenant and agree for the equal and ratable benefit of the Holders of the Notes as follows:</div>

<p><strong>Definitions and Rules of Construction.</strong> Establishes the defined terms, interpretive rules, Limited Condition Transaction provisions, and compliance determination mechanics for this indenture. As an AMC-issued instrument (not Muvico), the defined terms reflect AMC's direct obligations and the "Restricted Subsidiary" framework rather than the Muvico group structure used in DOC 2. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The definitions determine the scope of every covenant. Because this is an AMC-level instrument, terms like "Restricted Subsidiary" and "Unrestricted Subsidiary" apply at the AMC consolidated level, giving AMC more flexibility through subsidiary designation.</p>

<p><strong>The Notes</strong> covers issuance mechanics, form, authentication, transfer, and interest computation. Unlike DOC 2 (which has PIK mechanics), these are straightforward fixed-rate cash-pay notes at 7.500%. The aggregate principal amount is unlimited, with Additional Notes issuable subject to covenant compliance. Interest is computed on a 360-day year. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The fixed-rate, cash-pay structure means AMC must actually pay 7.5% interest in cash every period, unlike Muvico's PIK notes where interest can compound as additional principal.</p>
