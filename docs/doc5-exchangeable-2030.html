Additional Notes may be issued from time to time by the Company, subject to compliance with Section 4.05 and the other provisions of this Indenture, without notice to or consent of the Holders and shall be consolidated with and form a single class with the Initial Notes; provided that such Additional Notes will not be issued with the same CUSIP number as the Initial Notes unless such Additional Notes are fungible with the Initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes; provided, further, that the Company’s ability to issue Additional Notes shall be subject to the Company’s compliance with Section 4.05(b)(ii). All Notes issued under this Indenture shall be treated as a single class for all purposes of this Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase.
(b)            In the event that the Required Shareholder Approval is not obtained within one hundred eighty (180) days of the Issue Date, the Company shall promptly issue $15,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Additional Notes (the “Consent Fee Notes”) to the Initial Holders, pro rata based on the percentage of outstanding Notes held by each such Initial Holder as of the Issue Date and rounded to the nearest $1.00 increment.
(c)            Subject to Section 2.03, the Trustee shall authenticate the Initial Notes for original issue on the Issue Date in the aggregate principal amount of $194,380,981. With respect to any Additional Notes issued after the Issue Date, there shall be established in or pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors, and subject to Section 2.03, set forth, or determined in the manner provided in an Officer’s Certificate, or established in one or more indentures supplemental hereto, prior to the issuance of such Additional Notes:
(i)            [reserved];

(iii)          the issue price and issuance date of such Additional Notes, including the date from which interest on such Additional Notes shall accrue; and
(iv)          if applicable, that such Additional Notes shall be issuable in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Notes and, in such case, the respective depositories for such Global Notes, the form of any legend or legends that shall be borne by any such Global Notes in addition to or in lieu of that set forth in Appendix I to Exhibit A and any circumstances in addition to or in lieu of those set forth in Section 2.3 of Exhibit A in which any such Global Notes may be exchanged in whole or in part for Additional Notes registered, and any transfer of such Global Notes in whole or in part may be registered, in the name or names of Persons other than the depository for such Global Note or a nominee thereof.
(d)            If any of the terms of any Additional Notes are established by action taken pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officer’s Certificate or the trust indenture supplemental hereto setting forth the terms of the Additional Notes</div>

At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, solely to the extent permitted or required by the terms of this Indenture, the Company may deliver (i) Additional Notes and (ii) PIK Notes executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a written order of the Company in the form of an Officer’s Certificate for the authentication and delivery of such Additional Notes or PIK Notes, as applicable, and the Trustee in accordance with such written order of the Company shall authenticate and deliver such Notes.
A Note shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the Note. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Note has been authenticated under this Indenture.
The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to authenticate the Notes. Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Notes whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as any Registrar, Paying Agent or agent for service of notices and demands.
The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Notes if the issue thereof will adversely affect the Trustee’s own rights, duties, indemnities or immunities under the Notes and this Indenture.</div>

The initial Registrar and transfer agent for the Notes will be GLAS Trust Company LLC.
The initial Exchange Agent will be GLAS Trust Company LLC.
The Registrars and the transfer agents will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Notes in the form of Definitive Notes (as defined in Exhibit A) outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive Notes on behalf of the Company. Each transfer agent shall perform the functions of a transfer agent.
The Company may change any Paying Agent, Exchange Agent, Registrar or transfer agent for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders of the Notes. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, Exchange Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.
The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Registrar, Paying Agent, Exchange Agent or transfer agent not a party to this Indenture. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such agent. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the name and address of any such agent. If the Company fails to maintain a Registrar, Paying Agent, Exchange Agent or transfer agent, the Trustee shall act as such and shall be entitled to appropriate compensation therefor pursuant to Section 7.07. The Company or any of its domestic Wholly Owned Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, Exchange Agent, Registrar or transfer agent.</div>

            <div class="raw-section">By no later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date on which any principal of or interest on any Note is due, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent for such Note a sum sufficient to pay such principal and interest so becoming due and/or, if the Company is entitled to pay PIK Interest with respect to an interest payment period as provided for in Section 2.14, increase the principal amount of the Notes to pay any PIK Interest pursuant to a written direction delivered to the Trustee specifying the increase in the Global Note, or in the limited circumstances where the Notes are no longer held in global form, issue PIK Notes to pay any PIK Interest pursuant to an Authentication Order with respect to the PIK Interest to be issued on the applicable Interest Payment Date, when so becoming due. The Company shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that such Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or the Trustee all money held by such Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or interest on the Notes and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Company or any Guarantor in making any such payment. If the Company or a domestic Wholly Owned Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed by such Paying Agent. Upon complying with this Section 2.05, the Paying Agent (if other than the Company or a domestic Wholly Owned Subsidiary) shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee.</div>

If required by the Trustee or the Company, such Holder shall furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of the Company and the Trustee to protect the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent for such Note, the Registrar for such Note and any co-registrar from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Note is replaced.

Subject to Section 13.06, a Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Note.
If a Note is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee and the Company receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Note is held by a protected purchaser.
If a Paying Agent segregates and holds in trust, in accordance with this Indenture, on a redemption date or maturity date money sufficient to pay all principal and interest payable on that date with respect to the Notes (or portions thereof) to be redeemed or maturing, as the case may be, and such Paying Agent is not prohibited from paying such money to the Holders on that date pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, then on and after that date such Notes (or portions thereof) cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.</div>

After the preparation of definitive Notes, the temporary Notes shall be exchangeable for definitive Notes upon surrender of the temporary Notes at any office or agency maintained by the Company for that purpose and such exchange shall be without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Notes, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery in exchange therefor, one or more definitive Notes representing an equal principal amount of Notes.

The Trustee and no one else shall cancel (subject to the record retention requirements of the Exchange Act), in accordance with the Trustee’s customary procedures, all Notes surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment or cancellation and deliver canceled Notes to the Company upon a written direction of the Company. Except as expressly permitted herein, the Company may not issue new Notes to replace Notes it has redeemed, paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
If the Company or any Guarantor acquires any of the Notes, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the Indebtedness represented by such Notes unless and until the same are surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to this Section 2.10. The Company may not issue new Notes to replace Notes it has paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for any reason other than in connection with a registration of transfer or exchange of such Notes.
At such time as all beneficial interests in a Global Note have either been exchanged for definitive Notes, transferred, redeemed, repurchased or canceled, such Global Note shall be returned by the Securities Custodian with respect to such Global Note to the Trustee for cancellation or retained and canceled by the Trustee. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any beneficial interest in a Global Note is exchanged for definitive Notes, transferred in exchange for an interest in another Global Note, redeemed, repurchased or canceled, the principal amount of Notes represented by such Global Note shall be reduced and an adjustment shall be made on the books and records of the Trustee (if it is then the Securities Custodian for such Global Note) with respect to such Global Note, by the Trustee or the Securities Custodian, to reflect such reduction.</div>

The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of defaulted interest proposed to be paid on each Note and the date (not less than thirty (30) days after such notice) of the proposed payment (the “Special Interest Payment Date”), and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such defaulted interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such defaulted interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a record date (the “Special Record Date”) for the payment of such defaulted interest, which date shall be not more than fifteen (15) days and not less than ten (10) days prior to the Special Interest Payment Date and not less than ten (10) days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date, and in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such defaulted interest and the Special Record Date and Special Interest Payment Date therefor to be given in the manner provided for in Section 13.02, not less than ten (10) days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such defaulted interest and the Special Record Date and Special Interest Payment Date therefor having been so given, such defaulted interest shall be paid on the Special Interest Payment Date to the Persons in whose names the Notes (or their respective predecessor Notes) are registered at the Close of Business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable.
The Company may make payment of any defaulted interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.11, each Note delivered under this Indenture upon registration of, transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Note shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Note.</div>

<p><strong>Redemption</strong> for the Exchangeable Notes uses a <strong>Soft Call</strong> mechanism rather than a traditional hard call. This means redemption is only available under specific market conditions (typically when the stock price exceeds a threshold relative to the exchange price). There is also a Special Mandatory Redemption and a Fundamental Change put right, giving holders the ability to force repurchase in certain scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>Soft Call.</strong> The Company may redeem all (but not less than all) notes only if the closing price of AMC common stock exceeds a specified premium to the Exchange Price for a defined period. This is fundamentally different from a standard hard call: the Company cannot simply call the notes at any time by paying a premium. The Soft Call protects exchangeable noteholders from being called away just when the exchange option becomes most valuable. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> If AMC's stock price rises significantly, these notes' exchange value increases. The Soft Call ensures holders can benefit from upside rather than being forced to accept a par redemption when the exchange is "in the money."</p>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Holder that has submitted a Notice of Voluntary Exchange may not revoke or rescind such Notice of Voluntary Exchange as a result of a Soft Call Condition Failure.
The Soft Call Notice shall identify the Notes to be redeemed and shall state:

(b)            Once a Soft Call Notice is sent in accordance with Section 3.04, the Notes (subject to such Holder’s right to exchange any such Notes in accordance with Section 3.04 and Article X) shall become due and payable on the Soft Call Date and at the Soft Call Redemption Price stated in the Soft Call Notice, unless there occurs a Soft Call Condition Failure. The Soft Call Notice, if sent in the manner provided in Section 3.04, shall be conclusively presumed to have been given, whether or not the Holder receives such Soft Call Notice. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such Notes shall be paid at the Soft Call Redemption Price stated in the Soft Call Notice, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Soft Call Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the related Interest Payment Date that is on or prior to the Soft Call Date). Subject to Section 3.06, on and after the Soft Call Date, unless the Company defaults in payment of the Soft Call Redemption Price, interest shall cease to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption, unless such redemption remains conditioned on the occurrence of a future event that has not occurred. Failure to give notice or any defect in the notice to any Holder shall not affect the validity of the notice to any other Holder.</div>

<p><strong>Fundamental Change Put Right.</strong> Upon a Fundamental Change (defined to include mergers, asset sales, delisting, and change of control events), each holder may require the Company to repurchase their notes at <strong>100% of principal plus accrued interest</strong>. This gives holders a floor value protection: even if the exchange option is underwater, they can put notes back at par in the event of a major corporate change.</p>

              <div class="legal-text">(a)            Subject to the other terms of this Section 3.10, if a Fundamental Change occurs, then each Holder will have the right (the “Fundamental Change Repurchase Right”) to require the Company to repurchase such Holder’s Notes (or any portion thereof in amounts of $1.00 or whole multiples of $1.00 in excess thereof) on the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date for such Fundamental Change for a cash purchase price equal to the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price.
(b)            If the principal amount of the Notes has been accelerated in accordance with this Indenture and such acceleration has not been rescinded on or before the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date for a Repurchase Upon Fundamental Change (except in the case of an acceleration resulting from a Default by the Company in the payment of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price with respect to the Notes), then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 3.10(a), (i) the Company may not repurchase any Notes pursuant to this Section 3.10; and (ii) the Company will cause any Notes theretofore surrendered for such Repurchase Upon Fundamental Change (but not yet repurchased) to be returned to the Holders thereof (or, if applicable with respect to Global Notes, cancel any instructions for book-entry transfer to the Company, the Trustee or the Paying Agent of the applicable beneficial interest in such Notes in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC).
(c)            [reserved].
(d)            If a Fundamental Change Repurchase Date is after a record date and on or before the next Interest Payment Date, then (i) the Holder of such Note at the Close of Business on such record date will be entitled, notwithstanding such Repurchase Upon Fundamental Change, to receive, on or, at the Company’s election, before such Interest Payment Date, the unpaid interest that would have accrued on such Note to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date (assuming, solely for these purposes, that such Note remained outstanding through such Interest Payment Date, if such Fundamental Change Repurchase Date is before such Interest Payment Date); and (ii) the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price will not include accrued and unpaid interest on such Note to, but excluding, such Fundamental Change Repurchase Date. For the avoidance of doubt, if an Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day and such Fundamental Change Repurchase Date occurs on the Business Day immediately after such Interest Payment Date, then (x) accrued and unpaid interest on Notes to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date will be paid on the next Business Day to Holders as of the Close of Business on the immediately preceding record date; and (y) the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price will include interest on Notes to be repurchased from, and including, such Interest Payment Date.
(e)            On or before the twentieth calendar day after the effective date of a Fundamental Change, the Company will send to each Holder, the Trustee and the Paying Agent a notice of such Fundamental Change (a “Fundamental Change Notice”). Substantially contemporaneously, the Company will issue a press release through such national newswire service as the Company then uses (or publish the same through such other widely disseminated public medium as the Company then uses, including its website) containing the information set forth in such Fundamental Change Notice. Such Fundamental Change Notice must state:
(i)            briefly, the events causing such Fundamental Change;
(ii)           the effective date of such Fundamental Change;
(iii)          the procedures that a Holder must follow to require the Company to repurchase its Notes pursuant to this Section 3.10, including the deadline for exercising the Fundamental Change Repurchase Right and the procedures for submitting and withdrawing a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice;
(iv)          the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date for such Fundamental Change;
(v)           the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price per $1.00 principal amount of Notes for such Fundamental Change (and, if such Fundamental Change Repurchase Date is after a record date and on or before the next Interest Payment Date, the amount, manner and timing of the interest payment payable pursuant to the definition thereof and Section 3.10(d));
(vi)          the name and address of the Paying Agent, Trustee and Exchange Agent;
(vii)         the Exchange Rate in effect on the date of such Fundamental Change Notice and a description and quantification of any adjustments to the Exchange Rate that may result from such Fundamental Change;
(viii)        that Notes for which a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice has been duly tendered and not duly withdrawn must be delivered to the Paying Agent for the Holder thereof to be entitled to receive the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price;
(ix)           that Notes (or any portion thereof) that are subject to a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice that have been duly tendered may be exchanged only if such Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice is withdrawn in accordance with this Indenture; and
(x)            the CUSIP and ISIN numbers, if any, of the Notes.
Neither the failure to deliver a Fundamental Change Notice nor any defect in a Fundamental Change Notice will limit the Fundamental Change Repurchase Right of any Holder or otherwise affect the validity of any proceedings relating to any Repurchase Upon Fundamental Change.
(f)            To exercise its Fundamental Change Repurchase Right for a Note following a Fundamental Change, the Holder thereof must deliver:
(i)             to the Paying Agent, before the Close of Business on the Business Day immediately before the related Fundamental Change Repurchase Date (or such later time as may be required by law), a duly completed, written Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice with respect to such Note; and
(ii)           such Note, to the Trustee duly endorsed for transfer (if such Note is a Definitive Note) or to the Paying Agent by book-entry transfer (if such Note is a Global Note).
The Paying Agent will promptly deliver to the Company a copy of each Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice that it receives.
(g)            Each Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice with respect to a Note must state:
(i)             if such Note is a Definitive Note, the certificate number of such Note;
(ii)            the principal amount of such Note to be repurchased, which must be in a minimum denomination of $1.00 or whole multiples of $1.00 in excess thereof; and
(iii)           that such Holder is exercising its Fundamental Change Repurchase Right with respect to such principal amount of such Note;
provided, however, that if such Note is a Global Note, then such Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice must comply with the applicable procedures of DTC (and any such Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice delivered in compliance with the applicable procedures of DTC will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this Section 3.10(g)).
(h)            A Holder that has delivered a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice with respect to a Note may withdraw such Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice by delivering a written notice of withdrawal to the Paying Agent at any time before the Close of Business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the related Fundamental Change Repurchase Date. Such withdrawal notice must state:
(i)             if such Note is a Definitive Note, the certificate number of such Note;
(ii)            the principal amount of such Note to be withdrawn, which must be in a minimum denomination of $1.00 or whole multiples of $1.00 in excess thereof; and
(iii)           the principal amount of such Note, if any, that remains subject to such Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice, which must be in a minimum denomination of $1.00 or whole multiples of $1.00 in excess thereof;
provided, however, that if such Note is a Global Note, then such withdrawal notice must comply with the applicable procedures of DTC (and any such withdrawal notice delivered in compliance with the applicable procedures of DTC will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this Section 3.10(h)).
Upon receipt of any such withdrawal notice with respect to a Note (or any portion thereof), the Paying Agent will (x) promptly deliver a copy of such withdrawal notice to the Company; and (y) if such Note is surrendered to the Paying Agent, cause such Note (or such portion thereof in accordance with Section 2.15, treating such Note as having been then surrendered for partial repurchase in the amount set forth in such withdrawal notice as remaining subject to repurchase) to be returned to the Holder thereof (or, if applicable with respect to any Global Note, cancel any instructions for book-entry transfer to the Company, the Trustee or the Paying Agent of the applicable beneficial interest in such Note in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC).
(i)            The Company will cause the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price for a Note (or portion thereof) to be repurchased pursuant to a Repurchase Upon Fundamental Change to be paid to the Holder thereof on or before the later of (i) the applicable Fundamental Change Repurchase Date; and (ii) the date (x) such Note is delivered to the Trustee or Paying Agent (in the case of a Definitive Note) or (y) the applicable procedures of DTC relating to the repurchase, and the delivery to the Paying Agent, of such Holder’s beneficial interest in such Note to be repurchased are complied with (in the case of a Global Note). For the avoidance of doubt, interest payable pursuant to Section 3.10(d) on any Note to be repurchased pursuant to a Repurchase Upon Fundamental Change must be paid pursuant to such Section regardless of whether such Note is delivered or such applicable procedures of DTC are complied with pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 3.10(i).
(j)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.10, the Company will be deemed to satisfy its obligations under this Section 3.10 if (i) one or more third parties conduct any Repurchase Upon Fundamental Change and related offer to repurchase Notes otherwise required by this Section 3.10 in a manner that would have satisfied the requirements of this Section 3.10 if conducted directly by the Company; and (ii) an owner of a beneficial interest in any Note repurchased by such third party or parties will not receive a lesser amount (as a result of taxes, additional expenses or for any other reason) than such owner would have received had the Company repurchased such Note.
(k)            The Company will comply in all material respects with all federal and state securities laws in connection with a Repurchase Upon Fundamental Change (including complying with Rules 13e-4 and 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and filing any required Schedule TO, to the extent applicable) so as to permit effecting such Repurchase Upon Fundamental Change in the manner set forth in this Indenture; provided, however, that, to the extent that the Company’s obligations pursuant to this Section 3.10 conflict with any law or regulation that is applicable to the Company, the Company’s compliance with such law or regulation will not be considered to be a default of such obligations.
(l)            Subject to the terms of this Section 3.10, Notes may be repurchased pursuant to a Repurchase Upon Fundamental Change in part, but only in a minimum denomination of $1.00 or whole multiples of $1.00 in excess thereof. Provisions of this Section 3.10 applying to the repurchase of a Note in whole will equally apply to the repurchase of a permitted portion of a Note.</div>

<p><strong>Muvico Group Corporate Separateness.</strong> The Company must maintain its separate corporate existence and identity from AMC and its other subsidiaries. Requirements include: separate books and records, separate financial statements, separate bank accounts, and arm's-length intercompany transactions. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> This prevents "substantive consolidation" arguments in bankruptcy. If Muvico's assets and liabilities were consolidated with AMC's, the carefully negotiated lien priority structure would collapse. By maintaining separateness, Muvico-level secured creditors (DOC 2, 4, 5, 7) preserve their priority claim on Muvico's theatre assets.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Covenants of Holdings and Odeon Holdco.</strong> These covenants apply specifically to Centertainment Development, LLC (Holdings) and Odeon Holdco. They restrict Holdings from engaging in any business activity other than holding equity in the Company (Muvico) and related administrative activities. This "clean holdco" requirement ensures that no unrelated liabilities or claims attach at the Holdings level, preserving the direct chain of equity ownership for secured creditors.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Covenants of AMC Group Obligors and Odeon Holdco Subsidiaries.</strong> These covenants impose specific obligations on AMC and its direct subsidiaries in their capacity as Guarantors. Key requirements include maintaining the guarantee, providing financial information, and complying with limitations on intercompany transfers of Muvico Group assets. This ensures AMC cannot strip assets from the guaranteed entities.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="raw-section">(a)            If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(e) or (f)) occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee, by notice to the Company, or the Holders of not less than thirty percent (30%) in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding, by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal of, premium, if any (including the Early Acceleration Premium, as set forth in this Section 6.02), and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, all the Notes to be due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(e) or (f) occurs and is continuing, then the principal of, premium, if any (including the Early Acceleration Premium, as set forth in this Section 6.02), and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, all the Notes shall automatically become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. The Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Notes if in the reasonable judgment of the Trustee, acceleration is not in the interest of the Holders.
(b)            At any time after a declaration of acceleration has been made, but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as provided hereinafter in this Article, the Required Holders, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences, if:
(i)            the Company has paid or deposited, or caused to be paid or deposited, with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:
(A)            all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel;
(B)            all overdue interest on all Notes;
(C)            the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Notes that has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate borne by the Notes; and
(D)            to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate borne by the Notes; and
(ii)            all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of principal of the Notes which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 6.04.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
(c)            In the event of any Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(d), such Event of Default and all consequences thereof shall be automatically annulled if, within ten (10) Business Days after such Event of Default arose, the Company delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that (x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged, (y) the holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default or (z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured, it being understood that in no event shall an acceleration of the principal amount of the Notes as described above be annulled, waived or rescinded upon the happening of any such events.
If the Notes are accelerated or otherwise become due prior to their Stated Maturity, in each case as a result of an Event of Default whether automatically or by declaration, the amount of principal of, accrued and unpaid interest and premium on the Notes that shall automatically and immediately then be due and payable shall be equal to the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to, but excluding, such date of acceleration plus (i) if the Required Shareholder Approval has been obtained by the applicable date, the Exchange Adjustment Consideration (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be paid as Cash Exchange Adjustment Consideration), as if such acceleration were a Voluntary Exchange of the Notes so accelerated, or (ii) if the Required Shareholder Approval has not been obtained by the applicable date, (A) the Applicable Premium in effect on such date, if any, or (B) the redemption premium applicable to the Notes as of such date (as set forth in Section 6 of the Notes), if any (the amount determined in accordance with the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the “Early Acceleration Premium”).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Notes are accelerated or otherwise become due prior to their Stated Maturity, in each case, in respect of any Event of Default (including an event of default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization (including the acceleration of claim by operation of law)), the Early Acceleration Premium shall also be automatically and immediately due and payable, without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent or any Holder, as though the Notes had been subject to a Voluntary Exchange or optional redemption, as applicable, and shall constitute part of the Exchangeable Notes Obligations in view of the impracticability and difficulty of ascertaining actual damages and by mutual agreement of the parties as to a reasonable calculation of each Holder’s lost profits as a result thereof. If the Early Acceleration Premium becomes due and payable, it shall be deemed to be principal of the Notes and interest shall accrue on the full principal amount of the Notes (including the Early Acceleration Premium) from and after the applicable triggering event, including in connection with certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company. Any premium payable above shall be presumed to be liquidated damages sustained by each Holder as the result of the acceleration of the Notes (and not unmatured interest or a penalty) and AMC, Holdings, the Company, Odeon Holdco and each other Guarantor agrees that it is reasonable under the circumstances currently existing. The premium shall also be automatically and immediately due and payable in the event the Notes or this Indenture are satisfied, released or discharged through foreclosure, whether by judicial proceeding or otherwise, deed in lieu of foreclosure or by any other means. EACH OF AMC, HOLDINGS, THE COMPANY, ODEON HOLDCO AND EACH OTHER GUARANTOR EXPRESSLY WAIVES (TO THE FULLEST EXTENT IT MAY LAWFULLY DO SO) THE PROVISIONS OF ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE STATUTE OR LAW THAT PROHIBITS OR MAY PROHIBIT THE COLLECTION OF THE FOREGOING PREMIUM IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH ACCELERATION. AMC, Holdings, the Company, Odeon Holdco and each other Guarantor expressly agrees (to the fullest extent it may lawfully do so) that: (A) the foregoing premium is reasonable and is the product of an arm’s-length transaction between sophisticated business entities ably represented by counsel; (B) the foregoing premium shall be payable under the circumstances described herein notwithstanding the then prevailing market rates at the time acceleration occurs; (C) there has been a course of conduct between Holders and such Person giving specific consideration in this transaction for such agreement to pay the foregoing premium; (D) such Person shall be estopped hereafter from claiming differently than as agreed to in this paragraph; and (E) such Person shall not challenge or question, or support any other Person in challenging or questioning, the validity or enforceability of the Early Acceleration Premium under the circumstances described herein, and such Person shall be estopped from raising or relying on any judicial decision or ruling questioning the validity or enforceability of any prepayment fee similar or comparable to the Early Acceleration Premium. AMC, Holdings, the Company, Odeon Holdco and each other Guarantor expressly acknowledges that its agreement to pay or guarantee the premium to Holders as herein described are individually and collectively a material inducement to Holders to purchase the Notes and that such premium to Holders shall be deemed to be earned on the Issue Date.</div>

(b)            Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:
(i)            the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
(ii)            in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, and will be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein).
(c)            The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:
(i)            this clause (c) does not limit the effect of clause (b) of this Section 7.01;
(ii)            the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Trust Officer unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and

(f)             Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
(g)            No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers.
(h)            The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a Trust Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Notes and this Indenture.</div>

(b)            Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officer’s Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on the Officer’s Certificate or Opinion of Counsel.
(c)            The Trustee may act through agents and shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed with due care.

(f)             In no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for special, indirect, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, loss of profit) irrespective of whether the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.
(g)            The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a Trust Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Notes and this Indenture.

            <div class="raw-section">The Company shall pay to the Trustee (acting in any capacity hereunder) and any predecessor Trustee from time to time such compensation for its services as shall from time to time be agreed to in writing by the Company and the Trustee. The Trustee’s compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee (acting in any capacity hereunder) upon request for all documented expenses incurred or made by it, including costs of collection, in addition to the compensation for its services. Such expenses shall include the documented compensation and expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee’s agents, counsel, accountants and experts. The Company shall indemnify the Trustee (acting in any capacity hereunder) against any and all loss, liability or expense (including documented attorneys’ fees) incurred by it in connection with the acceptance and administration of this trust and the performance of its duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not reimburse any expenses or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee’s own willful misconduct or gross negligence. The Company need not pay for any settlement made by the Trustee without the Company’s consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. All rights, protections, indemnifications and releases from liability granted hereunder to the Trustee shall extend to it acting in any capacity hereunder and its officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns.
To secure the Company’s payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Notes on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee other than money or property held in trust to pay principal of and interest on particular Notes.
The Company’s payment obligations pursuant to this Section shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and the discharge of this Indenture. When the Trustee incurs expenses after the occurrence of a Default specified in Section 6.01(e) or (f) with respect to the Company, the expenses are intended to constitute expenses of administration under the Bankruptcy Law.

(b)            the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent;
(c)            a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
(d)            the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting.
If the Trustee resigns, is removed by the Company or by the Required Holders and such Holders do not reasonably promptly (but in any event, within thirty (30) days following such resignation or removal) appoint a successor Trustee, or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason (the Trustee in such event being referred to herein as the retiring Trustee), the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee.
A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07.
If a successor Trustee does not take office within sixty (60) days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee or the Holders of 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Note for at least six months may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
Notwithstanding the replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section, the Company’s obligations under Section 7.07 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.</div>

<p><strong>Exchange of Notes - The equity exchange mechanics</strong> are the defining feature of this instrument. Notes are exchangeable into AMC common stock at a specified Exchange Rate, with anti-dilution adjustments and special settlement provisions. The exchange feature gives holders equity upside participation while maintaining a debt floor value. This is structurally similar to a convertible bond but with additional complexity from the Muvico/AMC dual-entity structure.</p>

<p><strong>Exchange Privilege.</strong> Each holder has the right to exchange their notes for AMC common stock at the applicable Exchange Rate. The exchange is exercisable at any time prior to maturity (subject to certain blackout periods). The Exchange Rate represents the number of shares of AMC common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. <strong>Key detail:</strong> Unlike standard convertibles, the exchange is into <em>AMC parent stock</em> even though the notes are issued by Muvico. This creates structural complexity in the equity delivery mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>Settlement of Exchange Privilege.</strong> Upon exchange, the Company must deliver the applicable number of shares of AMC common stock (plus cash for any fractional shares). The Company may elect to settle in cash, shares, or a combination. Settlement must occur within 2 Business Days. <strong>Why settlement method matters:</strong> If the Company elects cash settlement, it must pay the volume-weighted average price for the applicable number of shares.

(i)             if the Company elects to satisfy the Company’s exchange obligations with respect to any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes subject to such Voluntary Exchange through shares of Common Stock, the Company shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the exchanging Holder in respect of the amount of the Notes being exchanged, a whole number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of: (A) 1/1000, (B) the principal amount of Notes subject to such exchange plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the Exchange Date, and (C) the Exchange Rate; and
(ii)            if the Company elects to satisfy the Company’s exchange obligations with respect to any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes subject to such Voluntary Exchange in cash, the Company shall deliver and pay (or cause to be delivered and paid) to the exchanging Holder (1) in respect of the principal amount of the Notes being exchanged, a whole number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of: (A) 1/1000, (B) the principal amount of Notes subject to such exchange, and (C) the Exchange Rate, and (2) cash equal to the amount of accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to, but excluding, the Exchange Date.
(d)            Delivery or payment, as the case may be, of the Exchange Consideration due upon exchange in accordance with this Section 10.03 shall occur on the Exchange Date.
(e)            Each exchange shall be deemed to have been effected immediately preceding the Close of Business on the relevant Exchange Date; provided, however, that the Person in whose name any shares of Common Stock shall be issuable upon such exchange shall be treated as the holder of record of such shares as of the Close of Business on the Exchange Date. Upon an exchange of any Notes, and without prejudice to such Holder’s right to any payment under Section 10.04(b) and under the last sentence thereof, such person will no longer be a Holder of such Notes surrendered for exchange.
(f)            Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Holder exchanges its Notes pursuant to a Voluntary Exchange such that the Exchange Date therefor is after the Close of Business on a record date but prior to the Open of Business on the immediately following Interest Payment Date, to the extent the Holder of such Notes at the Close of Business on such record date receives the interest payable on such Notes on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding such exchange, then for purposes of the definition of “Exchange Consideration” when used with respect to such Notes, accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes shall be deemed paid and no increase to the Exchange Consideration shall be made and the Holder may be required to reimburse the Company in cash for any excess accrued interest paid in respect of the period between the Exchange Date and the next Interest Payment Date.
(g)            If any Note is submitted for exchange to the Exchange Agent or the Exchange Agent receives any Notice of Voluntary Exchange with respect to a Note, then the Exchange Agent will promptly (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days following any Voluntary Exchange Notice Date) notify the Company and the Trustee of such occurrence, together with any other information reasonably requested by the Company or Exchange Agent, and will cooperate with the Company to determine the Exchange Date for such Note in accordance with the definition thereof.

(a)            If AMC issues or otherwise distributes shares of Common Stock exclusively as a dividend or distribution to all or substantially all holders of the shares of Common Stock (other than any Received Dividend), or if AMC effects a share split or share combination of the Common Stock (in each case, excluding an issuance solely pursuant to a Merger Event, as to which Section 10.12 will apply), the Exchange Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where,
ER0 =	the Exchange Rate in effect immediately preceding the Open of Business on the “ex” date of such dividend or distribution, or immediately preceding the Open of Business on the effective date of such share split or share combination, as the case may be;
ER1 =	the new Exchange Rate in effect immediately after the Open of Business on such “ex” date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately after the Open of Business on the effective date of such share split or share combination, as the case may be;
OS0 =	the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately preceding to the Open of Business on such “ex” date or immediately preceding to the Open of Business on the effective date of such share split or share combination, as the case may be; and
OS1 =	the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after, and solely as a result of, giving effect to such dividend, distribution, share split or share combination.
Any adjustment made under this Section 10.06(a) shall become effective immediately after the Open of Business on the “ex” date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately after the Open of Business on the effective date for such share split or share combination, as applicable. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this clause (a) is announced or declared but not so paid or made, the Exchange Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay or make such dividend or distribution, to the Exchange Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been announced or declared. For the avoidance of doubt, if the application of the foregoing formula would result in a decrease in the Exchange Rate, no adjustment to the Exchange Rate will be made (other than (i) as result of a reverse share split, share combination or equivalent action thereto or (ii) with respect to the readjustment of the Exchange Rate as described in the immediately preceding sentence).
For purposes of this Section 10.06 and Section 10.07, “effective date” means the first date on which shares of Common Stock trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, reflecting the relevant share split or share combination, as applicable.
(b)            If AMC distributes to all or substantially all holders of shares of Common Stock any rights, options or warrants (other than pursuant to a shareholder rights plan, as to which Section 10.06(i) will apply) entitling them for a period of not more than forty-five (45) days from the record date of such distribution to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share that is less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the shares of Common Stock on the ten (10) consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the date that such distribution was first publicly announced (other than any Received Dividend), the Exchange Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
where,
ER0 =	the Exchange Rate in effect immediately preceding the Open of Business on the “ex” date for such distribution;
ER1 =	the new Exchange Rate in effect immediately after the Open of Business on the “ex” date for such distribution;
OS0 =	the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately preceding the Open of Business on the “ex” date for such distribution;
X =	the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights, options or warrants; and
Y =	the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient of (x) the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, options or warrants, divided by (y) the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the shares of Common Stock over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending on (and including) the Trading Day immediately preceding the date “ex” date for such distribution.
Any increase in the Exchange Rate made under this Section 10.06(b) shall become effective immediately after the Open of Business on the “ex” date for such distribution.
For purposes of this Section 10.06(b), in determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price less than such average of Last Reported Sale Prices of the shares of Common Stock, and in determining the aggregate exercise price payable for such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by AMC for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors. To the extent that any such rights, options or warrants are not exercised or converted prior to the expiration of the exercisability or convertibility thereof, the new Exchange Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the time of such expiration, to the Exchange Rate that would then be in effect if such rights, options or warrants had not been so distributed. If any such dividend or distribution in this clause (b) is announced or declared but not paid or made, the new Exchange Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to make or pay such dividend or distribution, to be the Exchange Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been announced or declared. For the avoidance of doubt, if the application of the foregoing formula would result in a decrease in the Exchange Rate, no adjustment to the Exchange Rate will be made (other than with respect to the readjustment of the Exchange Rate as described in the two immediately preceding sentences).
(c)            If AMC distributes shares of the Company’s Capital Stock, evidences of AMC’s indebtedness, other assets or property of AMC or rights, options or warrants to acquire its Capital Stock or other securities to all or substantially all holders of shares of Common Stock, excluding:
(i)            dividends or distributions of shares, or of rights, options or warrants to purchase or subscribe for shares, of Common Stock as to which the provisions of Section 10.06(a) or Section 10.06(b), as applicable, shall apply;
(ii)           dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash as to which the provisions of Section 10.06(d) shall apply;
(iii)          dividends or distributions of Reference Property solely pursuant to a Merger Event, as to which the provisions of Section 10.12 shall apply;
(iv)          any distribution constituting a Received Dividend;
(v)           rights issued or otherwise distributed pursuant to a shareholder rights or similar plan, except to the extent provided in Section 10.01(i);
(vi)          a distribution solely pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of Common Stock, as to which the provisions of Section 10.06(e) shall apply; and
(vii)         Spin-Offs as to which the provisions set forth below in this Section 10.06(c) shall apply,
(any of such shares of Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness, other assets or property or rights, options or warrants, the “Distributed Property”), then the Exchange Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
where,
ER0 =	the Exchange Rate in effect immediately preceding the Open of Business on the “ex” date for such distribution;
ER1 =	the new Exchange Rate in effect immediately after the Open of Business on the “ex” date for such distribution;
SP0 =	the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the shares of Common Stock over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending on (and including) the Trading Day immediately preceding the “ex” date for such distribution; and
FMV =	the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith) of the Distributed Property with respect to each outstanding share of Common Stock on the “ex” date for such distribution.
Any increase made under the portion of this Section 10.06(c) set forth above shall become effective immediately after the Open of Business on the “ex” date for such distribution.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if “FMV” (as defined above) is equal to or greater than “SP0” (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder of a Note shall receive, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of shares of Common Stock and solely as a result of holding such Note, without having to exchange such Note, the amount and kind of Distributed Property that such Holder would have received if such Holder had held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the Exchange Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on the date for determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution multiplied by (ii) the quotient of (x) the aggregate principal amount of such Note divided by (y) $1,000, and Section 10.06(o) shall apply to such distribution as if such distribution were a Received Dividend. If the Board of Directors determines the “FMV” (as defined above) of any distribution for purposes of this Section 10.06(c) by reference to the actual or when-issued trading market for any securities, it shall in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the average of Last Reported Sale Prices of the shares of Common Stock over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending on (and including) the Trading Day immediately preceding the “ex” date for such distribution. If any such distribution described in this Section 10.06(c) is declared or announced but not paid or made, the new Exchange Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to make or pay such distribution, to be the Exchange Rate that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared or announced. For the avoidance of doubt, if the application of the foregoing formula would result in a decrease in the Exchange Rate, no adjustment to the Exchange Rate will be made (other than with respect to the readjustment of the Exchange Rate as described in the immediately preceding sentence).
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 10.06(c) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the shares of Common Stock of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of AMC (other than solely pursuant to a Merger Event, as to which Section 10.12 shall apply, or a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of Common Stock, as to which Section 10.06(e) shall apply), that are, or, when issued, will be, listed or admitted for trading on a U.S. national securities exchange (a “Spin-Off”), the Exchange Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
where,
ER0 =	the Exchange Rate in effect immediately preceding the Close of Business on the last Trading Day of the Valuation Period;
ER1 =	the new Exchange Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on the last Trading Day of the Valuation Period;
FMV =	the product of (x) the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices per share or unit of the Capital Stock or similar equity interest distributed in such Spin-Off (determined by reference to the definition of “Last Reported Sale Price” as set forth in Section 1.01 of this Indenture as if references therein to shares of Common Stock were to such Capital Stock or similar equity interest) over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period commencing on (and including) the “ex” date of the Spin-Off (such period, the “Valuation Period”) and (y) the number of shares or units of such Capital Stock or similar equity interests distributed per share of Common Stock in such distribution; and
MP0 =	the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the shares of Common Stock over the Valuation Period.
The increase to the Exchange Rate under the preceding paragraph shall be determined on the last Trading Day of the Valuation Period; provided, however, that in respect of any exchange of Notes, if the relevant Exchange Date occurs during the Valuation Period, in determining the Exchange Rate, references in the preceding paragraph with respect to ten (10) consecutive Trading Days shall be deemed to be replaced with such lesser number of consecutive Trading Days as have elapsed from (and including) the “ex” date of such Spin-Off to (but excluding) such Exchange Date.
If any such distribution described in this Section 10.06(c) is declared or announced but not paid or made, the new Exchange Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to make or pay such distribution, to be the Exchange Rate that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared or announced. For the avoidance of doubt, if the application of the foregoing formula would result in a decrease in the Exchange Rate, no adjustment to the Exchange Rate will be made (other than with respect to the readjustment of the Exchange Rate as described in the immediately preceding sentence).
For purposes of this Section 10.06(c) (and subject in all respects to Section 10.06(i)), rights, options or warrants distributed by AMC to all holders of shares of Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of AMC’s Capital Stock, including Common Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until the occurrence of specified event or events (“Trigger Event”): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of the Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of the Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 10.06(c) (and no adjustment to the Exchange Rate under this Section 10.06(c) will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Exchange Rate shall be made under this Section 10.06(c). If any such right, option or warrant, including any such existing rights, options or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, options or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and “ex” date with respect to new rights, options or warrants with such rights, options (in which case the existing rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to terminate and expire on such date without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other such event (of the type described in the immediately preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was deemed to effect a distribution of rights, options or warrants, in each case for which an adjustment to the Exchange Rate under this Section 10.06(c) was made, (1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or purchased without exercise by any holders thereof, upon such final redemption or purchase (x) the Exchange Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options or warrants had not been issued and (y) the Exchange Rate shall then again be readjusted, effective as of the date of such final redemption or purchase, to give effect to such distribution, deemed distribution or Trigger Event or other such event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or purchase price received by a holder or holders of shares of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights, options or warrants), made to all holders of shares of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or purchase, and (2) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Exchange Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of such expiration or termination date, as if such rights, options and warrants had not been issued.
For purposes of Section 10.06(a), Section 10.06(b), Section 10.06(d) and this Section 10.06(c), if any dividend or distribution to which this Section 10.06(c) or Section 10.06(d) is applicable (other than a Spin-Off) has the same “ex” date as one or both of:
(A)            a dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock to which Section 10.06(a) is applicable (the “Clause A Distribution”); or
(B)            a dividend or distribution of rights, options or warrants to which Section 10.06(b) is applicable (the “Clause B Distribution”),
then, in either case, (1) such dividend or distribution, other than the Clause A Distribution and the Clause B Distribution, shall be deemed to be a dividend or distribution to which this Section 10.06(c) or Section 10.06(d), as the case may be, is applicable (the “Clause C or D Distribution”) and any Exchange Rate adjustment required by this Section 10.06(c) or Section 10.06(d), as the case may be, with respect to such Clause C or D Distribution shall first be made, and (2) the “ex” date for the Clause B Distribution, if any, shall be deemed to immediately follow the “ex” date for the Clause C or D Distribution and any Exchange Rate adjustment required by Section 10.06(b) with respect to the Clause B Distribution shall then be made immediately after the adjustment pursuant to clause (1), except that, if determined by the Company, any shares of Common Stock that become outstanding as a result of the Clause A Distribution or the Clause B Distribution shall not be deemed to be “outstanding immediately preceding the Open of Business on the “ex” date” within the meaning of Section 10.06(b), and (3) the “ex” date for the Clause A Distribution, if any, shall be deemed to immediately follow the “ex” date for the Clause C or D Distribution or the Clause B Distribution, as the case may be, and any Exchange Rate adjustment required by Section 10.06(a) with respect to the Clause A Distribution shall then be made immediately after the adjustments pursuant to clauses (1) and (2), except that, if determined by the Company, any shares of Common Stock that become outstanding as a result of the Clause A Distribution shall not be deemed to be “outstanding immediately preceding the Open of Business on such “ex” date” within the meaning of Section 10.06(a).
(d)            If AMC distributes any cash dividend or distribution to all or substantially all holders of shares of Common Stock (other than (i) any distribution of Reference Property pursuant to a Merger Event specified in Section 10.12 and (ii) any Received Dividend), the Exchange Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where,
ER0 =	the Exchange Rate in effect immediately preceding the Open of Business on the “ex” date for such dividend or distribution;
ER’ =	the new Exchange Rate in effect immediately after the Open of Business on the “ex” date for such dividend or distribution;
SP0 =	the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the shares of Common Stock over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending on (and including) the Trading Day immediately preceding the “ex” date for such dividend or distribution;
C =	the amount of such cash dividend or distribution the Company distributes on account of one share of Common Stock.
Any increase in the Exchange Rate made under this Section 10.06(d) shall become effective immediately after the Open of Business on the “ex” date for such dividend or distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if “C” (as defined above) is equal to or greater than “SP0” (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder of a Note shall receive, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of shares of Common Stock and solely as a result of holding Notes, without having to exchange such Note, the amount of cash that such Holder would have received if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the Exchange Rate in effect on the “ex” date for such cash dividend or distribution multiplied by (ii) the quotient of (x) the aggregate principal amount of such Note divided by (y) $1,000, and Section 10.06(o) shall apply to such dividend or distribution as if such dividend or distribution were a Received Dividend. If any dividend or distribution described in this Section 10.06(d) is announced or declared but not so paid or made, the new Exchange Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to make or pay such dividend or distribution, to be the Exchange Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been announced or declared. For the avoidance of doubt, if the application of the foregoing formula would result in a decrease in the Exchange Rate, no adjustment to the Exchange Rate will be made (other than with respect to the readjustment of the Exchange Rate as described in the immediately preceding sentence).
(e)            If AMC or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender or exchange offer for shares of Common Stock (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in the case of a reverse split off) that is subject to the then applicable tender offer rules under the Exchange Act (other than open market repurchases or an odd-lot tender offer), to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the shares of Common Stock over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Days commencing on (and including) the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, the Exchange Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
where,
ER0 =	the Exchange Rate in effect immediately preceding the Close of Business on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires;
ER1 =	the new Exchange Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires;
AC =	the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration (as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith) paid or payable for shares of Common Stock purchased in such tender or exchange offer;
OS0 =	the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately preceding the date such tender or exchange offer expires (prior to giving effect to the purchase of any shares of Common Stock accepted for purchase or exchange in such tender or exchange offer);
OS1 =	the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the date such tender or exchange offer expires (after giving effect to the purchase of all shares of Common Stock accepted for purchase or exchange pursuant to such tender or exchange offer); and
SP1 =	the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the shares of Common Stock over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period commencing on (and including) the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires.
The increase in the Exchange Rate under this Section 10.06(e) shall be determined on the last Trading Day of such ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period but shall become effective and be given effect at the Close of Business on the tenth Trading Day immediately following (and including) the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires; provided, however, that in respect of any exchange of Notes, if the relevant Exchange Date occurs within such ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period, in determining the Exchange Rate, references in the preceding paragraph with respect to ten (10) consecutive Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of consecutive Trading Days as have elapsed from (and including) the Trading Day next succeeding the expiration date of such tender or exchange offer to (but excluding) such Exchange Date.
If AMC or one of its Subsidiaries is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer but AMC or Subsidiary is ultimately prevented by applicable law from effecting all or any portion of such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the new Exchange Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines that applicable law so prevents, or rescinds, such purchases, to the Exchange Rate that would be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made or had been made only in respect of such purchases that had been effected. For the avoidance of doubt, if the application of the formula in the preceding paragraph would result in a decrease in the Exchange Rate, no adjustment to the Exchange Rate will be made (other than with respect to the readjustment of the Exchange Rate as described in the immediately preceding sentence).
(f)            [reserved].
(g)            Notwithstanding this Section 10.06 or any other provision of this Indenture or the Notes, if an Exchange Rate adjustment becomes effective on any “ex” date as specified in Sections 10.06(a) through (e), and a Holder has exchanged its Note and the Exchange Date in respect of such exchange is on or after such “ex” date and on or prior to the related record date and such Holder would be treated as the record holder of shares of Common Stock as of the related Exchange Date pursuant to Section 10.03(e) based on an adjusted Exchange Rate otherwise becoming effective on such “ex” date, then, notwithstanding the foregoing Exchange Rate adjustment provisions, the Exchange Rate adjustment otherwise becoming effective on such “ex” date shall not be made for such exchanging Holder; and, instead, such Holder shall be treated as if such Holder were the record owner of the shares of Common Stock such Holder is entitled to receive upon exchange on an unadjusted basis and participate in the related dividend, distribution or other event giving rise to such adjustment.
(h)            Except as stated in this Indenture, the Company will not adjust the Exchange Rate for the issuance or acquisition of shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock or the right to purchase shares of Common Stock or such convertible or exchangeable securities. The applicable Exchange Rate will not be adjusted:
(i)            upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on AMC’s securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan;
(ii)           upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or restricted stock units or rights (including shareholder appreciation rights) to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by AMC or any of its Subsidiaries;
(iii)          upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any right or warrant or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security not described in this Section 10.06(h) and outstanding as of the Issue Date, including pursuant to the Permitted Transactions;
(iv)          upon the repurchase of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to an odd lot tender offer or an open-market share repurchase program or other buy-back transaction that is not a tender offer or exchange offer of the nature described in Section 10.06(e);
(v)           for a change solely in the par value of the shares of Common Stock; or
(vi)          for accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
(i)            If AMC adopts a shareholder rights plan, then upon exchange of the Notes, in addition to the consideration otherwise payable in connection with such exchange, Holders will receive from the Company a corresponding amount of rights consistent with the rights distributed by AMC to other holders of Common Stock under such rights plan, unless prior to any exchange, the shareholder rights plan expires or terminates or the rights have separated from the shares of Common Stock in accordance with such rights plan, in which case, and only in such case, the Exchange Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if AMC distributed, to all holders of shares of Common Stock, Distributed Property consisting of such rights as described in Section 10.06(c), subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.
(j)            In addition to those adjustments required by clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 10.06, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and applicable listing rules of any U.S. national securities exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are then listed, (i) the Company in its sole discretion from time to time may increase the Exchange Rate by any amount for a period of at least twenty (20) Business Days and (ii) the Company may also (but is not required to) increase the Exchange Rate to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of shares of Common Stock or rights to purchase shares of Common Stock in connection with a dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock (or rights to acquire shares of Common Stock) or similar event. Whenever the Exchange Rate is increased pursuant to either of the preceding two sentences, the Company shall deliver to the Holder of each Note at its last address appearing on the note register a notice of the increase at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date the increased Exchange Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Exchange Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
(k)            Adjustments to the Exchange Rate shall be calculated to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share.
(l)            For purposes of this Section 10.06, (i) the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of AMC so long as AMC does not make or issue any dividend or distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of AMC but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock; and (ii) the dividend or distribution of any issued shares of Common Stock owned or held by or for the account of AMC shall be deemed a dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock.
(m)            For the avoidance of doubt, the closing of the Permitted Transactions shall not result in any adjustment of the Exchange Rate, or any other terms of the Notes except as set forth herein.
(n)            Prior to the date for determination of holders of shares of Common Stock entitled to receive a distribution constituting a Received Dividend, the Company shall deliver a written notice to the Trustee that the Company intends to treat such distribution as a “Received Dividend” hereunder. If the Company shall have given such a notice to the Trustee of its intention to treat a distribution as a Received Dividend, the Company and AMC shall not permit any tender or exchange offer to which Section 10.06(e) applies to expire on, or on any day within the period of ten (10) Trading Days ending on (and including) the Trading Day next preceding, such date for determination.
(o)            At the same time AMC makes a distribution constituting a Received Dividend to holders of Common Stock, the Company shall distribute, to each Person who was the Holder of a Note that was outstanding immediately after the Close of Business on the date for determination of holders of shares of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution (whether or not such Note is outstanding on the date of such distribution), an amount equal to the amount of securities, cash or other assets that would have been receivable upon such distribution by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the Exchange Rate in effect at such time multiplied by (ii) the quotient of (x) the aggregate principal amount of such Note divided by (y) $1,000.</div>

(a)            AMC shall at all times following receipt of the Required Shareholder Approval maintain authorized for issuance and available, out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock or shares of Common Stock held in treasury that are not committed for any other purpose, free from preemptive rights, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common Stock required to settle all exchanges contemplated by this Indenture, including in respect of the Initial Notes and the full amount of Additional Notes issuable hereunder (including in each case, any PIK Notes or interest that has been paid in kind thereon, as applicable) and the full amount of Shares Exchange Adjustment Consideration that could be payable hereunder on such Notes (and interest that has been paid in kind thereon) if it were elected.
(b)            AMC shall ensure at all times following receipt of the Required Shareholder Approval that all shares of Common Stock to be issued and delivered upon exchange of Notes have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable, free of restrictions on transfer and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof (other than taxes payable by the Holder in respect of any issuance in a different name as specified in Section 10.10).
(c)            If on the relevant Exchange Date the Common Stock is listed on any U.S. national securities exchange or automated quotation system, the Common Stock to be issued upon exchange of the Notes shall be listed on such exchange or automated quotation system.
(d)            If any shares of Common Stock to be issued or delivered upon exchange of Notes hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares of Common Stock may be validly issued or delivered upon exchange, AMC has secured such registration or obtained such approval, as the case may be.

then, in each case (unless notice of such event is otherwise required pursuant to another provision of this Indenture excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Section 10.08), the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and the Exchange Agent and to be sent to each Holder at such Holder’s address appearing on the note register, as promptly as practicable but in any event at least five (5) Business Days prior to the applicable date specified in clause (x) or (y) below (or, if the date on which the Company first knows of the applicable date specified in clause (x) or (y) below is later than such applicable date, no more than five (5) Business Days after such date on which the Company first has such knowledge), or, in any such case, prior to such earlier time as notice thereof shall be required to be given pursuant to Rule 10b-17 under the Exchange Act, a notice stating (x) the date as of which the holders of record of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the purpose of such action by AMC or one of its Subsidiaries or, in the case of a share split or share combination, the effective date of such share split or share combination or, in the case of a tender or exchange offer, the date on which such tender offer or exchange offer commences, or (y) the date on which such Merger Event, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective or occur, and, if applicable, the date as of which it is expected that holders of record of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such Merger Event, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of any such event or the operation of any provision herein consequent on or relating to such event.
If at any time the Company or AMC shall cancel any of the proposed transactions for which notice has been given under this Section 10.11 prior to the consummation hereof, the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and the Exchange Agent and to be sent to each Holder at such Holder’s address appearing on the note register, as promptly as practicable, notice of such cancellation.</div>

(i)            any recapitalization, reclassification or change of the shares of Common Stock (other than a change only in par value or from par value to no par value or no par value to par value or solely as a result of a stock split or reverse stock split or subdivision or combination involving solely Common Stock that do not involve the issuance of any other series or class of securities);
(ii)           any consolidation, merger or combination involving AMC;
(iii)          any sale, lease or other transfer of the assets of AMC substantially as an entirety;
(iv)          any or binding statutory share exchange involving AMC; or
(v)           other similar event,
in each case, as a result of which the shares of Common Stock are converted into, or exchanged for, or represent solely the right to receive, stock, other securities, other property or assets (including cash) or any combination thereof (any such event, a “Merger Event”; and such stock, other securities and/or other property or assets (including cash), the “Reference Property”; with each “unit of Reference Property” meaning the kind and amount of Reference Property that a holder of one share of Common Stock would have owned or been entitled to receive on account of such Merger Event), then (x) from and after the effective time of such Merger Event, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture or the Notes, the right to exchange each $1,000 of Notes for a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Exchange Rate will be determined in the same manner as if each reference to any number of shares of Common Stock in this Article X (or in any related definitions) were instead a reference to the same number of units of Reference Property and (y) at or prior to the effective time of such Merger Event, the Company, AMC, any other Person that is the surviving or transferee Person (if not AMC) of such Merger Event and (if applicable) any other issuer of securities constituting Reference Property, shall execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in accordance with Section 9.01 and this Section 10.12 providing for such change in the right to exchange each $1,000 of Notes;
provided, however, that, at and after the effective time of such Merger Event (i) any amount payable in cash upon exchange of the Notes as set forth under this Article X will continue to be payable in cash, subject to the adjustments contained in this Section 10.12, (ii) [reserved], (iii) the Daily VWAP of any unit of Reference Property or portion thereof that consists of a class of common equity securities will be determined by reference to the definition of “Daily VWAP”, substituting, if applicable, the Bloomberg page for such class of securities in such definition, (iv) the Daily VWAP of any unit of Reference Property or portion thereof that does not consist of a class of common equity securities, and the Last Reported Sale Price of any unit of Reference Property or portion thereof that does not consist of a class of common equity securities, will be the fair value of such unit of Reference Property or portion thereof, as applicable, determined in good faith by the Company (or, in the case of cash denominated in U.S. dollars, the face amount thereof) and (v) for purposes of the definition of “Fundamental Change” the term “Common Stock” and “common equity” will be deemed to mean the common equity (including depositary receipts representing common equity), if any, forming part of such Reference Property.
If the Merger Event causes a holder of Common Stock to own or receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of shareholder election), then:
(1)            the amount and type of Reference Property that a holder of shares of Common Stock would have owned or been entitled to receive in such Merger Event (and for which the Notes will be exchangeable) will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration actually owned or received by the holders of shares of Common Stock; and
(2)            the unit of Reference Property shall refer to the consideration referred to in clause (1) attributable to one share of Common Stock.
The Company shall notify, in writing, the Holders, the Trustee and the Exchange Agent (if other than the Trustee) of the types and amounts of consideration (including such weighted average) comprising a unit of Reference Property as soon as practicable after such determination is made.
If the unit of Reference Property consists entirely of cash in such Merger Event, then for all exchanges for which the Exchange Date occurs after the effective date of such Merger Event:
(A)          the consideration due upon exchange of Notes thereafter shall be paid solely in cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the quotient of (x) the amount of the Notes being exchanged on the Exchange Date divided by (y) $1,000, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Rate in effect on the Exchange Date, multiplied by (iii) the amount of cash constituting the unit of Reference Property; and
(B)           the Company shall satisfy the Company’s exchange obligation by paying cash to converting Holders on the second Business Day immediately following the Exchange Date.
Such supplemental indenture described in the first paragraph of this Section 10.12(a) shall provide for anti-dilution and other adjustments, in respect of the Reference Property, and covenants that the Board of Directors of AMC shall reasonably determine in good faith to be as nearly equivalent as is practicable to the adjustments and covenants provided for in this Article X in respect of Common Stock and otherwise preserve the economic interests of the Holders.
(b)            When the Company executes and delivers a supplemental indenture pursuant to Section 10.12(a), the Company shall promptly (i) deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefor, the kind or amount of cash, securities or property or assets that will comprise a unit of Reference Property after any such Merger Event, any adjustment to be made with respect thereto and that all conditions precedent in this Indenture to such execution and delivery have been complied with, (ii) an Opinion of Counsel that all conditions precedent to the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture have been complied with, and (iii) mail notice thereof to each Holder at its last address appearing on the note register or to DTC. The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Holder, at its address appearing on the note register provided for in this Notes Indenture, within sixty (60) calendar days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
(c)            Neither the Company nor AMC shall become a party to any Merger Event unless its terms are consistent with this Section 10.12. None of the foregoing provisions shall affect the right of a Holder to exchange its Notes into shares of Common Stock as set forth in Section 10.03 prior to the effective time of such Merger Event.
(d)            The above provisions of this Section 10.12 shall similarly apply to successive Merger Events.
(e)            Notwithstanding the Exchange Rate adjustment provisions described in Sections 10.06(a) through (e), no adjustment to the Exchange Rate shall be made pursuant to such provisions in the event of any dividend, distribution, share split, share combination or issuance upon a Merger Event to which the provisions under this Section 10.12 apply.</div>

              <div class="legal-text">(a)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture or the Notes, no shares of Common Stock will be issued or delivered upon exchange of any Note (and in the case of a Notice of Voluntary Exchange not in connection with a Soft Call, the Note will not be exchangeable) to the extent, and only to the extent, that such exchange would result in such Holder (together with its Affiliates and any Person whose beneficial ownership of Common Stock would be aggregated with that of the Holder for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the applicable regulations of the SEC), or a “person” or “group” (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) that includes such Holder, beneficially owning in excess of 9.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately after giving effect to such exchange (the restrictions set forth in this sentence, the “Ownership Limitation”). Any election to exchange the Notes, including pursuant to a Notice of Voluntary Exchange, shall be deemed automatically not to have been so delivered with respect to such portion of Notes, and the Company shall have no obligation to deliver any Common Stock with respect to such exercise, to the extent that the delivery of such Common Stock or any other security otherwise deliverable upon such exercise would result in the Holder (together with its Affiliates and any Person whose beneficial ownership of Common Stock would be aggregated with that of the Holder for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the applicable regulations of the SEC), or a “person” or “group” (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) that includes such Holder, beneficially owning Common Stock in excess of the Ownership Limitation. For these purposes, beneficial ownership and calculations of percentage ownership will be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the applicable regulations of the SEC, including Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. For purposes of determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock a Holder may acquire upon the exchange of such Notes without exceeding the Ownership Limitation, such Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (x) AMC’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Current Report on Form 8-K or other public filing with the SEC, as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by AMC or (z) any other written notice by the Company or AMC setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (the “Reported Outstanding Share Number”). Upon any request of any Holder that indicates it may be subject to an Ownership Limitation in such Holder’s preparation for a Notice of Voluntary Exchange, the Company shall within one (1) Business Day confirm in writing (including by email) to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding (the latest confirmation, the “Confirmed Outstanding Share Number”). If the Confirmed Outstanding Share Number is greater than the actual number of outstanding shares of Common Stock at the time the Company receives a Notice of Voluntary Exchange, the Company shall, within one (1) Business Day, notify such Holder in writing (including by email) of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding and provide the Holder with the opportunity to submit a revised Notice of Voluntary Exchange before effecting such exchange. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations on the exchange of any Note pursuant to this Section 10.15 will not, in themselves, cause such Note to cease to be outstanding (and interest will continue to accrue on any portion of a Note that has been tendered for exchange and whose exchange is suspended pursuant to this Section 10.15), and such limitations will cease to apply if and when such Note’s exchange will not violate this Section 10.15. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 10.15 will affect the Company’s ability to elect any settlement method in accordance with this Indenture, so long as shares of Company Common Stock or any other security otherwise deliverable are not delivered in contravention of the Ownership Limitation.
(b)            If any Exchange Consideration or Shares Exchange Adjustment Consideration otherwise due upon the exchange of any Note is not delivered as a result of the Ownership Limitation, then the Company’s obligation to deliver such Exchange Consideration or Shares Exchange Adjustment Consideration will not be extinguished, and the Company will deliver such Exchange Consideration or Shares Exchange Adjustment Consideration within three (3) Business Days after the Holder of such Note provides written confirmation to the Company that such delivery will not contravene the Ownership Limitation. Any purported delivery of shares of Common Stock upon exchange of any Note will be void and have no effect to the extent, and only to the extent, that such delivery would contravene the Ownership Limitation. In the event that the issuance of Common Stock to the Holder upon the exchange of the Note results in the Holder, or a “person” or “group” (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) that includes such Holder, being deemed to beneficially own, in the aggregate, more than the Ownership Limitation (as determined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), such Common Stock in excess thereof shall be deemed null and void and shall be canceled ab initio, and the Holder shall not have the power to vote or to transfer such Common Stock; it being understood that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company remains obligated and will deliver such Common Stock within three (3) Business Days after the Holder of such Note provides written confirmation to the Company that such delivery will not contravene the Ownership Limitation.
(c)            The provisions of this Section 10.15 shall be construed, corrected and implemented in a manner so as to effectuate the intended beneficial ownership limitation herein contained. The Common Stock issuable upon exchange of the Notes in excess of the Ownership Limitation shall not be deemed to be beneficially owned by the Holder for any purpose, including for purposes of Section 13(d) or Rule 16a-1(a)(1) of the Exchange Act. No prior inability to convert such Notes pursuant to this Section 10.15 shall have any effect on the applicability of the provisions of this Section 10.15 with respect to any subsequent determination of convertibility. The limitation contained in this Section 10.15 shall apply to the successor holder of such Notes.
(d)            Upon the occurrence of a Merger Event, (i) the Ownership Limitation and this Section 10.15 will thereafter apply with respect to such issuer whose equity holders are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act as if each reference to “Common Stock” in this Section 10.15 were instead a reference to the common equity (including depositary receipts representing common equity), if any, forming part of the Reference Property of such Merger Event; and (ii) if such Reference Property includes no such common equity or depositary receipts or such issuer’s equity holders following such Merger Event are not subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, then the Ownership Limitation and this Section 10.15 will thereafter cease to apply.
(e)            Neither the Trustee nor the Exchange Agent shall have any duty or responsibility to monitor the Ownership Limitation or to monitor the Company’s or any Holder’s compliance with this Section 10.15 or have any liability or responsibility for such compliance</div>

            <div class="raw-section">Subject to the provisions of this Article XI, each Guarantor hereby fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, jointly and severally with each other Guarantor, to each Holder of the Notes and the Trustee, the full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and all other obligations and liabilities of the Company under this Indenture and the Notes (including, without limitation, any interest, fees or expenses accruing subsequent to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, whether or not such interest, fees or expenses is an allowed claim under applicable state, federal or foreign law and the obligations under Section 7.07) (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the “Guarantor Obligations”). Each Guarantor agrees that the Guarantor Obligations will rank equally in right of payment with other indebtedness of such Guarantor, except to the extent such other Indebtedness is subordinate to the Guarantor Obligations. Each Guarantor further agrees (to the extent permitted by law) that the Guarantor Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound under this Article XI notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guarantor Obligation.
Each Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of payment from and protest to the Company of any of the Guarantor Obligations and also waives notice of protest for non-payment. Each Guarantor waives notice of any default under the Notes or the Guarantor Obligations.
Each Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (and not a guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder to any security held for payment of the Guarantor Obligations.
Except as set forth in Section 11.02, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than payment of the Guarantor Obligations in full), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guarantor Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by (a) the failure of any Holder to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Company or any other person under, this Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal granted; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement; (d) the release of any security held by any Holder or the Trustee for the Guarantor Obligations or any of them; (e) the failure of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy against any other Guarantor; (f) any change in the ownership of the Company; (g) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guarantor Obligations; or (h) any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of such Guarantor as a matter of law or equity.
Each Guarantor agrees that its Guarantee herein shall remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the Guarantor Obligations or such Guarantor is released from its Guarantee in compliance with Section 11.03 hereof. Each Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any of the Guarantor Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise.
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay any of the Guarantor Obligations when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Holders an amount equal to the sum of (i) the unpaid amount of such Guarantor Obligations then due and owing and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest on such Guarantor Obligations then due and owing (but only to the extent not prohibited by law).
Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between such Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the Guarantor Obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in this Indenture for the purposes of its Guarantee herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Guarantor Obligations guaranteed hereby and (y) in the event of any such declaration of acceleration of such Guarantor Obligations, such Guarantor Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantor for the purposes of this Guarantee.
Each Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee or the Holders in enforcing any rights under this Section 11.01.</div>

Each such Guarantor agrees that its Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the absence of the endorsement of any notation of such Guarantee on the Notes.
Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that its Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Guarantee.

The Notes Collateral Agent agrees to act as such on the express conditions contained in this Section 12.08. Each Holder agrees that any action taken by the Notes Collateral Agent in accordance with the provision of this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents, and the exercise by the Notes Collateral Agent of any rights or remedies set forth herein and therein shall be authorized and binding upon all Holders. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements, the duties of the Notes Collateral Agent shall be ministerial and administrative in nature, and the Notes Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein and in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements to which the Notes Collateral Agent is a party, nor shall the Notes Collateral Agent have or be deemed to have any trust or other fiduciary relationship with the Trustee, any Holder or any Grantor, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements or otherwise exist against the Notes Collateral Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term “agent” in this Indenture with reference to the Notes Collateral Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.
(b)            The Notes Collateral Agent may perform any of its duties under this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements by or through receivers, agents, employees, attorneys-in-fact or with respect to any specified Person, such Person’s Affiliates, and the respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and attorneys-in-fact of such Person and its Affiliates (a “Related Person”), and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties, and shall be entitled to act upon, and shall be fully protected in taking action in reliance upon any advice or opinion given by legal counsel. The Notes Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any receiver, agent, employee, attorney-in-fact or Related Person that it selects as long as such selection was made in good faith and with due care.

The Notes Collateral Agent shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, or other paper or document. The Notes Collateral Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Trustee or the Required Holders as it determines and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Holders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Notes Collateral Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements in accordance with a request, direction, instruction or consent of the Trustee or the Required Holders and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Holders.
(e)            The Notes Collateral Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, unless a responsible officer of the Notes Collateral Agent shall have received written notice from the Trustee or the Company referring to this Indenture, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default.” The Notes Collateral Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be requested by the Trustee in accordance with Article VI or the Required Holders (subject to this Section 12.08).
(f)            The Notes Collateral Agent may resign at any time by notice to the Trustee and the Company, such resignation to be effective upon the acceptance of a successor agent to its appointment as Notes Collateral Agent. If the Notes Collateral Agent resigns under this Indenture, the Company shall appoint a successor collateral agent. If no successor collateral agent is appointed prior to the intended effective date of the resignation of the Notes Collateral Agent (as stated in the notice of resignation), the Trustee, at the direction of the Required Holders, may appoint a successor collateral agent, subject to the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and which shall not be required during a continuing Event of Default). If no successor collateral agent is appointed and consented to by the Company pursuant to the preceding sentence within thirty (30) days after the intended effective date of resignation (as stated in the notice of resignation) the Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor collateral agent hereunder, such successor collateral agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Notes Collateral Agent, and the term “Notes Collateral Agent” shall mean such successor collateral agent, and the retiring Notes Collateral Agent’s appointment, powers and duties as the Notes Collateral Agent shall be terminated. After the retiring Notes Collateral Agent’s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Section 12.08 shall continue to inure to its benefit and the retiring Notes Collateral Agent shall not by reason of such resignation be deemed to be released from liability as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Notes Collateral Agent under this Indenture.
(g)            The Trustee shall initially act as Notes Collateral Agent and shall be authorized to appoint co-Notes Collateral Agents as necessary in its sole discretion. Except as otherwise explicitly provided herein or in the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements, neither the Notes Collateral Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents or other Related Persons shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part thereof. The Notes Collateral Agent shall be accountable only for amounts that it actually receives as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither the Notes Collateral Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
(h)            The Notes Collateral Agent is authorized and directed to (i) enter into the Security Documents to which it is party, whether executed on or after the Issue Date, (ii) enter into the Intercreditor Agreements, including joinders and supplements thereto, whether executed on or after the Issue Date, (iii) make the representations of the Holders set forth in the Security Documents and Intercreditor Agreements, (iv) bind the Holders on the terms as set forth in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements and (v) perform and observe its obligations under the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements.
(i)             If at any time or times the Trustee shall receive (i) by payment, foreclosure, set-off or otherwise, any proceeds of Collateral or any payments with respect to the Obligations arising under, or relating to, this Indenture, except for any such proceeds or payments received by the Trustee from the Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, or (ii) payments from the Notes Collateral Agent in excess of the amount required to be paid to the Trustee pursuant to Article VI, the Trustee shall promptly turn the same over to the Notes Collateral Agent, in kind, and with such endorsements as may be required to negotiate the same to the Notes Collateral Agent, such proceeds to be applied by the Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements.
(j)             The Notes Collateral Agent is each Holder’s agent for the purpose of perfecting the Holders’ security interest in assets which, in accordance with Article 9 of the UCC can be perfected only by possession. Should the Trustee obtain possession of any such Collateral, upon request from the Company, the Trustee shall notify the Notes Collateral Agent thereof and promptly shall deliver such Collateral to the Notes Collateral Agent or otherwise deal with such Collateral in accordance with the Notes Collateral Agent’s instructions.
(k)            The Notes Collateral Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to the Trustee or any of the Holders to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by any Grantor or is cared for, protected, or insured or has been encumbered, or that the Notes Collateral Agent’s Liens have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected, maintained or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to determine whether all of the Grantor’s property constituting Collateral intended to be subject to the Lien and security interest of the Security Documents has been properly and completely listed or delivered, as the case may be, or the genuineness, validity, marketability or sufficiency thereof or title thereto, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities, and powers granted or available to the Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to this Indenture, any Security Document or the Intercreditor Agreements other than pursuant to the instructions of the Trustee or the Required Holders or as otherwise provided in the Security Documents.
(l)            If the Company or any Guarantor (i) incurs any obligations in respect of junior priority obligations at any time when no applicable Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement is in effect and (ii) delivers to the Notes Collateral Agent an Officer’s Certificate so stating and requesting the Notes Collateral Agent to enter into an applicable Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement in favor of a designated agent or representative for the holders of the junior priority obligations so incurred, the Notes Collateral Agent shall (and is hereby authorized and directed to) enter into such intercreditor agreement (at the sole expense and cost of the Company, including legal fees and expenses of the Notes Collateral Agent), bind the Holders on the terms set forth therein and perform and observe its obligations thereunder; provided that neither an Officer’s Certificate nor an Opinion of Counsel shall be required pursuant to this Section

(a) The Initial Notes and any Additional Notes shall be offered and sold by the Company from time to time and shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and each of the other Guarantors from time to time party to the Indenture. Unless issued in a transaction registered or exempt from, or not subject to the registration requirements under the Securities Act, the Initial Notes, any Additional Notes and any PIK Notes issued in respect thereof may be resold or transferred, initially, only to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and/or to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S.
(b)            Global Notes. Rule 144A Notes shall be issued, initially, in the form of one or more permanent global notes in fully registered form (the “Rule 144A Global Note”) and Regulation S Notes shall be issued, initially, in the form of one or more global notes in fully registered form (the “Temporary Regulation S Global Note”) and, following the termination of the Distribution Compliance Period the Temporary Regulation S Global Notes shall be exchanged for permanent global notes in fully registered form (the “Permanent Regulation S Global Note” and, together with the Temporary Regulation S Global Notes, the “Regulation S Global Notes”), in each case without interest coupons and bearing the Global Notes Legend and the Restricted Notes Legend, which shall be deposited on behalf of the purchasers of the Notes represented thereby with the Securities Custodian, and registered in the name of the Depository or a nominee of the Depository for the accounts of designated agents holding on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, duly executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee as provided in this Indenture. The Rule 144A Global Note and the Regulation S Global Note are each referred to herein as a “Global Note” and are collectively referred to herein as “Global Notes.” The aggregate principal amount of the Global Notes may from time to time be increased or decreased by adjustments made on the records of the Trustee and the Depository or its nominees and on the schedules thereto as hereinafter provided.
(c)            Book-Entry Provisions. This Section 2.1(c) shall apply only to a Global Note deposited with or on behalf of the Depository.
The Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with this Section 2.1(c) and pursuant to an order of the Company, authenticate and deliver, initially, one or more Global Notes that (a) shall be registered in the name of the Depository for such Global Note or Global Notes or the nominee of the Depository and (b) shall be delivered by the Trustee to the Depository pursuant to instructions of the Depository, or held by the Securities Custodian.
Members of, or participants in, the Depository (“Agent Members”) shall have no rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global Note held on their behalf by the Depository or by the Securities Custodian or under such Global Note, and the Depository may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner of such Global Note for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depository or impair, as between the Depository and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices of the Depository governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of a beneficial interest in any Global Note.
A-4
(d)            Definitive Notes. In the event the Company reasonably determines that any Additional Notes are not eligible for resale under Rule 144A, the Additional Notes may be issued as one or more Definitive Notes. Otherwise, except as provided in Section 2.3, owners of beneficial interests in Global Notes shall not be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated Notes.
2.2            Authentication. The Trustee shall authenticate and deliver (a) Initial Notes for original issue in an initial aggregate principal amount of $194,380,980, (b) Additional Notes in accordance with the Indenture and (c) any PIK Notes, if and when issued pursuant to the Indenture, in each case, upon a written order of the Company signed by two Officers. Such order shall specify the amount of the Notes to be authenticated and the date on which the original issue of Notes is to be authenticated.
2.3            Transfer and Exchange.
(a)            Transfer and Exchange of Definitive Notes. When Definitive Notes are presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request:
(i)            to register the transfer of such Definitive Notes; or
(ii)           to exchange such Definitive Notes for an equal principal amount of Definitive Notes of other authorized denominations, the Registrar or co-registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested if its reasonable requirements for such transaction are met; provided, however, that the Definitive Notes surrendered for transfer or exchange:
(1)            shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar or co-registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or such Holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing; and
(2)            are being transferred, or exchanged pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration under the Securities Act or pursuant to clause (A), (B) or (C) below, and are accompanied by the following additional information and documents, as applicable:
(A)            if such Definitive Notes are being delivered to the Registrar by a Holder for registration in the name of such Holder, without transfer, a certification from such Holder to that effect; or
(B)            if such Definitive Notes are being transferred to the Company, a certification to that effect; or
(C)            (i) if such Definitive Notes are being transferred pursuant to an exemption from registration in accordance with Rule 144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act or pursuant to or in compliance with an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act other than Rule 144, Rule 903 or Rule 904, a certification to that effect and (ii) if the Company so requests, an opinion of counsel or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to it as to compliance with the restrictions set forth in the legend set forth in Section 2.3(e)(i).
A-5

<p><strong>Redemption</strong> for the Exchangeable Notes uses a <strong>Soft Call</strong> mechanism rather than a traditional hard call. This means redemption is only available under specific market conditions (typically when the stock price exceeds a threshold relative to the exchange price). There is also a Special Mandatory Redemption and a Fundamental Change put right, giving holders the ability to force repurchase in certain scenarios.</p>

Schedule 4.17(a)
Mortgage Matters
Unless the Initial Purchasers holding a majority of the Notes then held by all Initial Purchasers shall otherwise consent (including through counsel to the Initial Purchasers by electronic mail to AMC):
1.	For each instance in which the Notes become entitled to a perfected security interest upon any Mortgaged Property as security for the Exchangeable Notes Obligations pursuant to Section 4.17 of the Indenture, within one hundred twenty (120) days (or such longer period as may be permitted under the Term Loan Agreement or any refinancing thereof), the Company and each Guarantor shall deliver to the Notes Collateral Agent:
(i)            counterparts of a Mortgage with respect to each Mortgaged Property duly executed and delivered by the record owner of such Mortgaged Property;
(ii)            a policy or policies of title insurance (or marked unconditional commitment to issue such policy or policies) in the amount equal to not less than 100% (or such lesser amount as reasonably agreed to by the Notes Collateral Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Holders)) of the Fair Market Value of such Mortgaged Property, as reasonably determined by AMC and agreed to by the Notes Collateral Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Holders), issued by a nationally recognized title insurance company insuring the Lien of each such Mortgage as a first priority Lien on the Mortgaged Property described therein, free of any other Liens except as expressly permitted by Section 4.07, together with such endorsements (other than a creditor’s rights endorsement), as the Notes Collateral Agent (acting at the direction the Required Holders) may reasonably request to the extent available in the applicable jurisdiction at commercially reasonable rates (provided, however, in lieu of a zoning endorsement the Notes Collateral Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Holders) shall accept a zoning letter);
(iii)          such affidavits and “gap” indemnifications as are customarily requested by the title company to induce the title company to issue the title policies and endorsements contemplated above,
(iv)          a survey of each Mortgaged Property (other than any Mortgaged Property to the extent comprised of condominiums and to the extent the same cannot be surveyed) in such form as shall be required by the title company to issue the so-called comprehensive and other survey-related endorsements and to remove the standard survey exceptions from the title policies and endorsements contemplated above (provided, however, that a survey shall not be required to the extent that the issuer of the applicable title insurance policy provides reasonable and customary survey-related coverages (including, without limitation, survey-related endorsements) in the applicable title insurance policy based on an existing survey and/or such other documentation as may be reasonably satisfactory to the title insurer),
(v)           a completed “Life of Loan” Federal Emergency Management (“FEMA”) Standard Flood Hazard Determination with respect to each Mortgaged Property subject to the applicable FEMA rules and regulations; and
(vi)         such customary legal opinions as the Notes Collateral Agent (acting at the direction of holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding) may reasonably request with respect to any such Mortgage or Mortgaged Property;
provided that the Notes Collateral Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Holders) may grant extensions of time or waivers for the creation and perfection of security interests in or the obtaining of title insurance, surveys, legal opinions or other deliverables with respect to particular assets where it determines that such action cannot be accomplished without undue effort or expense by the time or times at which it would otherwise be required to be accomplished by the Indenture or the Security Documents.
Schedule 4.17(b)
Control Agreements
Defined terms used in this Schedule 4.17(b) and not defined in the Indenture have the meanings ascribed to them in the Security Agreement. Unless the Initial Purchasers holding a majority of the Notes then held by all Initial Purchasers shall otherwise consent (including through counsel to the Initial Purchasers by electronic mail to AMC):
1.	Within sixty (60) days after the Issue Date, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to the Notes Collateral Agent Deposit Account Control Agreements and Securities Account Control Agreements, as applicable, with respect to all of the Grantors’ Deposit Accounts and Securities Accounts (in each case, that are not Excluded Accounts or Excluded Assets pursuant to clause (f) of the definition thereof) that are in existence on the Issue Date pursuant to Section 3.03(f) of the Muvico Security Agreement and Section 3.03(f) of the AMC Security Agreement.</div>
