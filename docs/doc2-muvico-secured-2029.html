<p><strong>Definitions and Rules of Construction.</strong> This article establishes the defined terms used throughout the indenture, rules of construction for interpreting the document, and provisions for Limited Condition Transactions and compliance determinations. Section 1.01 alone contains hundreds of defined terms that control how every other provision is interpreted. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The definitions effectively set the boundaries for every covenant and restriction in the indenture; creative drafting of definitions (like "Permitted Investments" or "Permitted Liens") can dramatically expand or contract what the issuer is allowed to do.</p>

<p><strong>Incorporation by Reference of Trust Indenture Act.</strong> Incorporates the applicable provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (TIA) into this indenture. If any provision of this indenture conflicts with the TIA, the TIA controls. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The TIA provides baseline federal protections for bondholders, including requirements around trustee independence, reporting, and holder rights that cannot be contracted away.</p>

The following Trust Indenture Act term used in this Indenture has the following meaning:
“obligor” on the Notes and the Guarantees means AMC and the Guarantors, respectively, and any successor obligor upon the Notes and the Guarantees, respectively.
All other terms used in this Indenture that are defined by the Trust Indenture Act, defined by Trust Indenture Act reference to another statute or defined by SEC rule under the Trust Indenture Act have the meanings so assigned to them.

<p><strong>Limited Condition Transactions.</strong> When the Company enters into a transaction whose consummation is conditioned on events outside its control (like an acquisition), compliance with financial tests can be measured at the time of signing rather than closing. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> This gives Muvico flexibility to commit to acquisitions or investments without the risk that market fluctuations between signing and closing would cause a technical covenant breach.</p>

(iii)          testing availability under baskets set forth in this Indenture (including baskets measured as a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Total Assets); in each case, at the option of the Company (the Company’s election to exercise such option in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction, an “LCT Election”), with such option to be exercised on or prior to the date of execution of the definitive agreements related to such Limited Condition Transaction, the date of determination of whether any such action is permitted hereunder, shall be deemed to be the date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Transaction are entered into (the “LCT Test Date”), and if, after giving Pro Forma Effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they had occurred at the beginning of the most recent Test Period ending prior to the LCT Test Date, the Company could have taken such action on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio or basket, such ratio or basket shall be deemed to have been complied with.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company has made an LCT Election and any of the ratios or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio or basket, including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the Company or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or action, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations; however, if any ratios improve or baskets increase as a result of such fluctuations, such improved ratios or baskets may be utilized. If the Company has made an LCT Election for any Limited Condition Transaction, then in connection with any subsequent calculation of the incurrence ratios subject to the LCT Election on or following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of (i) the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or (ii) the date that the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated or expires without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio or basket shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming such Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated.</div>

<p><strong>Certain Compliance Determinations.</strong> Allows the Company to designate or reclassify items under multiple permitted baskets simultaneously and to redesignate amounts between baskets after the fact, subject to compliance at the time of redesignation. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> This provides significant flexibility for the issuer to manage covenant headroom, effectively allowing it to shift transactions between different permitted categories to optimize compliance.</p>

<p><strong>The Notes</strong> covers the mechanics of the notes themselves: issuance, form, authentication, transfer, interest computation, and the critical PIK interest mechanism. The aggregate principal amount is unlimited, meaning Muvico can issue Additional Notes subject to covenant compliance. Interest is computed on a 360-day year basis. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The PIK interest provisions in Section 2.14 are the engine that allows Muvico's debt to compound when leverage is high, increasing the principal amount of outstanding notes without any cash payment.</p>

<p><strong>Amount of Notes; Issuable in Series.</strong> The aggregate principal amount of Notes that may be issued is unlimited. Additional Notes may be issued without holder consent, subject to compliance with the debt incurrence and lien covenants. All Notes form a single class for voting, amendments, and redemptions. The initial issuance was $856,964,000. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The ability to issue Additional Notes means the outstanding principal can grow beyond the initial $857M, diluting existing holders' recovery in a restructuring unless the incurrence tests prevent it.</p>

All Notes issued under this Indenture shall be treated as a single class for all purposes of this Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase.

(c)           the issue price and issuance date of such Additional Notes, including the date from which interest on such Additional Notes shall accrue; and
(d)           if applicable, that such Additional Notes shall be issuable in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Notes and, in such case, the respective depositories for such Global Notes, the form of any legend or legends that shall be borne by any such Global Notes in addition to or in lieu of that set forth in Appendix I to Exhibit A and any circumstances in addition to or in lieu of those set forth in Section 2.3 of Exhibit A in which any such Global Notes may be exchanged in whole or in part for Additional Notes registered, and any transfer of such Global Notes in whole or in part may be registered, in the name or names of Persons other than the depository for such Global Note or a nominee thereof.
If any of the terms of any Additional Notes are established by action taken pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officer’s Certificate or the trust indenture supplemental hereto setting forth the terms of the Additional Notes.</div>

<p><strong>Execution and Authentication.</strong> Notes must be signed by an Officer of the Company and authenticated by the Trustee to be valid. The Trustee may appoint authenticating agents.

A Note shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the Note. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Note has been authenticated under this Indenture.
The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to authenticate the Notes. Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Notes whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as any Registrar, Paying Agent or agent for service of notices and demands.
The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Notes if the issue thereof will adversely affect the Trustee’s own rights, duties, indemnities or immunities under the Notes and this Indenture.</div>

The initial Registrar and transfer agent for the Notes will be CSC Delaware Trust Company in New York.
The Registrars and the transfer agents will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Notes in the form of Definitive Notes (as defined in Exhibit A) outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive Notes on behalf of the Company.

At current ~19.4x Muvico leverage (Level 1), the Company pays 9% cash and 6% PIK, meaning the principal amount grows by 6% annually without any cash outflow. This compounding effect significantly increases the total debt burden over time.</p>

              <div class="legal-text">(a)           Unless previously redeemed, each Note will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Rate, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash and, to the extent provided in the Applicable Rate, in payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing December 15, 2025, to the Persons in whose names the Notes are registered in the security register for the Notes at the close of business on June 1 or December 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such applicable interest payment date. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, the date of issuance of such Notes (including Additional Notes).
(b)           If the Additional Rate is payable and the Company elects to pay it in PIK interest for an interest payment period, the Company shall deliver a written notice to the Trustee and the Holders prior to the fifteenth (15th) calendar day immediately prior to the interest payment date for such interest payment period, which notice shall state the form of interest payment with respect to such interest period and the total amount of interest to be paid on such interest payment date (a “PIK Election”). If a PIK Election is made in accordance with the previous sentence, such PIK interest shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.14(c). In the event that the Company does not make a timely PIK Election in accordance with this clause (b) for an interest payment period, then the Company shall be deemed to have elected to pay the Additional Rate, if applicable, in cash.
(c)           PIK interest on the Notes, if applicable, will be payable (x) with respect to Notes represented by one or more Global Notes registered in the name of, or held by, the Depository or its nominee on the relevant record date, by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding Global Note by an amount equal to the amount of PIK interest for the applicable interest period (rounded up to the nearest whole dollar) and (y) with respect to Notes not represented by Global Notes, by issuing Notes (rounded up to the nearest whole dollar) (“PIK Notes”), having the same terms and conditions as the Notes, in certificated form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the amount of PIK interest for the applicable period, and the Trustee will, at the request of the Company, authenticate and deliver such PIK Notes for original issuance to applicable Holders on the relevant record date, as shown by the records of the register of Holders. Following an increase in the principal amount of the outstanding Global Notes as a result of a payment of PIK interest, the Global Notes will bear interest on such increased principal amount from and after the date of such payment of PIK interest. Any PIK Notes issued in certificated form will be dated as of the applicable interest payment date and will bear interest from and after such date. All Notes issued pursuant to a payment of PIK interest will mature on the Maturity Date and will be governed by, and subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of this Indenture and shall have the same rights and benefits as the Notes issued on the Issue Date. Any certificated PIK Notes will be issued with the description “PIK” on the face of such PIK Note, and references to the “principal” or “principal amount” of the PIK Notes shall include any increase in the principal amount of the outstanding Notes as a result of any payment of PIK interest.
The calculation of PIK interest will be made by the Company or on behalf of the Company by such Person as the Company shall designate, and such calculation and verifying the correctness thereof shall not be a duty or obligation of the Trustee. Notwithstanding anything in this Indenture or the Notes to the contrary, the payment of accrued and unpaid interest (including interest that would otherwise be PIK interest when paid) in connection with any redemption of Notes as described in paragraph 6 of the Notes or Section 3.07 shall, in each case, be made solely in cash. PIK interest on the Notes will be paid in denominations of $1.00 and integral multiples of $1.00 in excess thereof.</div>

<p><strong>The Covenants</strong> are the core restrictions on what Muvico and AMC can do while these notes are outstanding. They limit new debt, restrict dividends and payments to equity holders, cap liens on assets, and control transactions with affiliates. For this instrument, the <strong>leverage-based interest rate grid</strong> is critical: the higher the Total Leverage Ratio, the more interest shifts from cash to PIK, growing the debt pile.</p>
<p>The interest rate structure is:
<strong>Base rate:</strong> 7.50% cash, plus incremental amounts based on leverage:
Level 1 (>= 7.50x leverage): +1.50% cash, +6.00% PIK = <strong>15% total</strong>;
Level 2 (6.50-7.50x): +2.375% cash, +2.375% PIK = <strong>12.25% total</strong>;
Level 3 (< 6.50x): +4.00% cash only = <strong>11.50% total</strong>.
At current ~19.4x Muvico leverage, these notes are firmly in Level 1, paying 9% cash + 6% PIK.</p>

<p><strong>Maintenance of Properties.</strong> AMC must keep all material property in good working order and condition (ordinary wear and tear excepted), except where failure would not have a Material Adverse Effect. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Since these notes are secured by Muvico's theatre assets, the requirement to maintain those properties protects the collateral value that backs noteholders' recovery.</p>

<p><strong>Limitation on Indebtedness</strong> restricts Muvico from taking on additional debt beyond specified baskets. The Company cannot incur new Indebtedness unless, after giving pro forma effect, the <strong>Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio</strong> is at least 2.00:1.00 (or another specified ratio). There are extensive carve-outs for: refinancing existing debt, capital leases, intercompany loans, and permitted incremental facilities. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> With current leverage at ~19.4x, Muvico is deeply restricted from incurring new debt outside the carved-out baskets. Any new financing would need to fit within specific exceptions rather than the general incurrence test.</p>

<p><strong>Limitation on Restricted Payments</strong> prevents Muvico/AMC from paying dividends, buying back stock, or making distributions to equity holders while these notes are outstanding. The general basket requires the Company to satisfy a Coverage Ratio test and caps cumulative restricted payments at a builder basket that grows with 50% of cumulative Consolidated Net Income. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> This is a critical protection for noteholders - it prevents the company from bleeding cash out to shareholders while creditors remain at risk. Given AMC's distressed leverage, this covenant is likely already binding.</p>

<p><strong>Limitation on Liens</strong> prevents Muvico from pledging its assets as collateral for other debt beyond what is already permitted. Permitted liens include: existing liens, liens securing the Term Loan and other first-priority debt, purchase money liens (capped), and general baskets for smaller amounts. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Since these notes have 1.5L priority at Muvico (junior to the $2B Term Loan), this covenant prevents Muvico from creating additional senior or pari passu liens that would further dilute these noteholders' collateral position.</p>

<p><strong>Asset Sales</strong> restricts Muvico from selling assets unless: (1) the consideration is at least <strong>fair market value</strong>, (2) at least <strong>75% of consideration is cash or cash equivalents</strong>, and (3) Net Proceeds are applied within 365 days to either reinvest in the business or repay senior secured debt. If Net Proceeds exceed a threshold and are not applied, Muvico must make an <strong>Excess Proceeds Offer</strong> to repurchase notes at par. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> This prevents the company from selling off valuable theatre assets and using the cash for other purposes (like paying dividends or servicing junior debt) without first giving these noteholders a chance to be repaid.</p>

<p><strong>Acceleration; Rescission and Annulment.</strong> Upon an Event of Default (other than bankruptcy), holders of at least 30% in principal amount or the Trustee may declare all Notes immediately due. Bankruptcy Events of Default trigger automatic acceleration. A majority of holders can rescind acceleration if the Company cures the defaults and pays overdue amounts. Critically, upon acceleration, the Company must pay the <strong>Applicable Premium</strong> as if the notes were optionally redeemed, creating a make-whole-like penalty. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The Applicable Premium on acceleration is unusual and creates a significant additional cost for the Company in a default scenario, effectively treating acceleration as an early redemption event.</p>

              <div class="legal-text">(a)            If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(e) or (f)) occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee, by notice to the Company, or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding, by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, all the Notes to be due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(e) or (f) occurs and is continuing, then the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, all the Notes shall automatically become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. The Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Notes if in the reasonable judgment of the Trustee, acceleration is not in the interest of the Holders.
(b)           At any time after a declaration of acceleration has been made, but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as provided hereinafter in this Article VI, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
(i)             the Company has paid or deposited, or caused to be paid or deposited, with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:
(A)          all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel;
(B)           all overdue interest on all Notes;
(C)           the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Notes that has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate borne by the Notes; and
(D)           to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate borne by the Notes; and
(ii)            all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of principal of the Notes which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 6.04.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
(c)           In the event of any Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(d), such Event of Default and all consequences thereof shall be automatically annulled if, within ten (10) Business Days after such Event of Default arose, the Company delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that (x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged, (y) the holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default or (z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured, it being understood that in no event shall an acceleration of the principal amount of the Notes as described above be annulled, waived or rescinded upon the happening of any such events.
(d)           If the Notes are accelerated or otherwise become due prior to their stated maturity (including the acceleration of any portion of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes by operation of law), the amount that shall then be due and payable shall be equal to:
(i)             (A) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding plus the Applicable Premium in effect on the date of such acceleration, or (B) the applicable redemption price in effect on the date of such acceleration, as applicable,
plus
(ii)           accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of such acceleration,
in each case as if such acceleration were an optional redemption of the Notes so accelerated.
(e)            Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, if the Notes are accelerated or otherwise become due prior to their stated maturity (including the acceleration of any portion of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes by operation of law), the Applicable Premium shall also be due and payable as though the Notes had been optionally redeemed on the date of such acceleration and shall constitute part of the obligations with respect to the Notes in view of the impracticability and difficulty of ascertaining actual damages and by mutual agreement of the parties as to a reasonable calculation of each holder’s lost profits as a result thereof. If the Applicable Premium becomes due and payable, it shall be deemed to be principal of the Notes and interest shall accrue on the full principal amount of the Notes (including the Applicable Premium or the Redemption Price Premium, as applicable) from and after the applicable triggering event. Any premium payable pursuant to this paragraph shall be presumed to be liquidated damages sustained by each Holder as the result of the acceleration of the Notes, and the Company agrees that it is reasonable under the circumstances currently existing. The premium shall also be payable in the event the Notes or this Indenture are satisfied, released or discharged through foreclosure, whether by judicial proceeding, deed in lieu of foreclosure or by any other means. THE COMPANY AND EACH GUARANTOR EXPRESSLY WAIVES (TO THE FULLEST EXTENT IT MAY LAWFULLY DO SO) THE PROVISIONS OF ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE STATUTE OR LAW THAT PROHIBITS OR MAY PROHIBIT THE COLLECTION OF THE FOREGOING PREMIUM IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH ACCELERATION. The Company expressly agrees (to the fullest extent it may lawfully do so) that: (A) the premium is reasonable and is the product of an arm’s length transaction between sophisticated business entities ably represented by counsel; (B) the premium shall be payable notwithstanding the then prevailing market rates at the time acceleration occurs; (C) there has been a course of conduct between the Holders and the Company giving specific consideration in this transaction for such agreement to pay the premium; and (D) the Company shall be estopped hereafter from claiming differently than as agreed to in this paragraph. The Company expressly acknowledges that its agreement to pay the premium to the Holders as herein described is a material inducement to the Holders to purchase the Notes.</div>

<p><strong>The Trustee</strong> article defines the role, duties, rights, and protections of CSC Delaware Trust Company as Trustee. The Trustee's duties are strictly limited to those expressly stated in the indenture -- no implied fiduciary duties. During a default, the Trustee must act with the care of a prudent person; otherwise, it performs only specified duties. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The Trustee is the key intermediary between holders and the issuer, but its limited duties mean holders must actively monitor and direct the Trustee rather than relying on it to independently protect their interests.</p>

<p><strong>Duties of Trustee.</strong> During an Event of Default, the Trustee must exercise its powers with the care of a prudent person. Outside of defaults, it performs only duties expressly stated in the indenture. The Trustee is not liable for good faith errors in judgment and may rely on certificates and opinions without independent investigation. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The heightened duty of care during defaults means the Trustee becomes more active when it matters most, but its limited pre-default obligations mean holders should not expect proactive monitoring.</p>

              <div class="legal-text">(a)            If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent Person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such Person’s own affairs.
(b)           Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:
(i)             the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
(ii)            in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, and will be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein).
(c)           The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own grossly negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:
(i)             this clause (c) does not limit the effect of clause (b) of this Section 7.01;
(ii)            the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Trust Officer unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
(iii)           the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.05.
(d)           Every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to clauses (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 7.01.
(e)           The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Company.
(f)            Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
(g)           No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers.
(h)           The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a Trust Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Notes and this Indenture.
(i)             For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee’s duties hereunder shall be strictly limited to those expressly set forth in this Indenture, and this Indenture shall not be interpreted to impose any implied fiduciary or other duties or obligations on the Trustee.</div>

<p><strong>Rights of Trustee.</strong> The Trustee may rely on documents believed genuine, may require Officer's Certificates or Opinions of Counsel before acting, may act through agents, and is not liable for good faith actions within its authority. It has no obligation to act at holder direction unless given satisfactory indemnity. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> These broad protections ensure the Trustee can function without fear of personal liability, but also mean holders must provide indemnification before the Trustee will take enforcement action.</p>

(a)           The Trustee may rely on any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper person. The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document. The Trustee may, however, in its discretion make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney.
(b)           Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officer’s Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on the Officer’s Certificate or Opinion of Counsel.
(c)            The Trustee may act through agents and shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed with due care.
(d)           The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith that it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers; provided, however, that the Trustee’s conduct does not constitute willful misconduct or negligence.
(e)           The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders, unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee, to the extent satisfactory to the Trustee, security or indemnity against the loss, liability or expense (including attorneys’ fees) that might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction.

(f)            In no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for special, indirect, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, loss of profit) irrespective of whether the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.
(g)           The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a Trust Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Notes and this Indenture.
(h)           The Trustee shall not be required to give a note, bond or surety in respect of the trusts and powers under this Indenture.
(i)            The Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection, and the advice or opinion of counsel with respect to legal matters relating to this Indenture and the Notes shall be full and complete authorization and protection from liability in respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel.
(j)            Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Indenture, any demand, request, direction or notice from the Company shall be sufficient if signed by an Officer of the Company.
(k)           The permissive rights of the Trustee to do things enumerated in this Indenture shall not be construed as a duty unless so specified herein.
(l)            None of the Trustee, Paying Agent nor Notes Collateral Agent shall have any liability or responsibility for any calculation hereunder or in connection with the Notes or for any data or other information used in any such calculation or determination hereunder.</div>

<p><strong>Compensation and Indemnity.</strong> The Company must pay the Trustee's compensation (not limited by trust law), reimburse all documented expenses, and indemnify against losses incurred in administering the trust (except for willful misconduct or gross negligence). The Trustee has a lien on all money or property it holds (other than amounts held in trust for specific payments) to secure these obligations. In bankruptcy, Trustee expenses constitute administrative expenses. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The Trustee's prior lien and administrative expense priority in bankruptcy means its fees are paid ahead of noteholders in a distressed scenario.</p>

The Trustee’s compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for all documented expenses incurred or made by it, including costs of collection, in addition to the compensation for its services. Such expenses shall include the documented compensation and expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee’s agents, counsel, accountants and experts. The Company shall indemnify the Trustee (acting in any capacity hereunder) against any and all loss, liability or expense (including documented attorneys’ fees) incurred by it in connection with the acceptance and administration of this trust and the performance of its duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not reimburse any expenses or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee’s own willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith. The Company need not pay for any settlement made by the Trustee without the Company’s consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. All rights, protections, indemnifications and releases from liability granted hereunder to the Trustee shall extend to it acting in any capacity hereunder and its officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns.
To secure the Company’s payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Notes on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee other than money or property held in trust to pay principal of and interest on particular Notes.
The Company’s indemnification and payment obligations pursuant to this Section shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and the discharge of this Indenture. When the Trustee incurs expenses after the occurrence of a Default specified in Section 6.01(e) or (f) with respect to the Company, the expenses are intended to constitute expenses of administration under the Bankruptcy Law.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and may appoint a successor Trustee by so notifying the resigning Trustee of its replacement. The Company shall remove the Trustee if:
(a)            the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10;
(b)            the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent;
(c)            a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or

If the Trustee resigns, is removed by the Company or by the Holders a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and such Holders do not reasonably promptly (but in any event, within 30 days following such resignation or removal) appoint a successor Trustee, or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason (the Trustee in such event being referred to herein as the retiring Trustee), the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee.
A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07.
If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee or the Holders of 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Note for at least six months may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
Notwithstanding the replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section, the Company’s obligations under Section 7.07 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.</div>

<p><strong>Discharge and Defeasance</strong> provides mechanisms for the Company to terminate its obligations under the indenture. Satisfaction and discharge occurs when all notes are paid or delivered for cancellation. Legal defeasance releases the Company from all obligations by depositing sufficient cash or Government Securities with the Trustee to pay all future amounts due. Covenant defeasance releases only from certain covenants while keeping the notes outstanding. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Defeasance is extremely unlikely for a distressed issuer like Muvico because it requires depositing enough risk-free assets to pay all future principal and interest -- something only well-capitalized issuers can afford.</p>

<p><strong>Discharge of Liability on Notes; Defeasance.</strong> The indenture is discharged when all notes are canceled or the Company deposits sufficient cash/Government Securities to pay all amounts due. The Company has two defeasance options: (1) legal defeasance, which releases all obligations and releases collateral liens, or (2) covenant defeasance, which releases obligations under Sections 4.03-4.10, 4.12, 4.13, 4.15-4.17, 4.19, and parts of Section 5.01. Certain obligations (Sections 2.03-2.09, 4.01, 7.07, 7.08, and 8.03-8.06) survive until notes are paid in full. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Legal defeasance effectively makes the notes risk-free by substituting government securities for the Company's credit, while covenant defeasance gives the Company freedom from restrictions while keeping the notes outstanding.</p>

The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option.
If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default.

<p><strong>Without Consent of Holders.</strong> The Company, Guarantors, Trustee, and Notes Collateral Agent may amend the indenture without holder consent to: cure ambiguities or defects, comply with successor entity requirements, provide for uncertificated notes, add guarantors or collateral, secure the notes further, add covenants for holder benefit, satisfy SEC requirements, conform to the offering document, or make changes that do not materially adversely affect holders. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> These carve-outs give the Company significant flexibility to make administrative and protective changes, but the "no material adverse effect" standard is the catch-all that limits the Company's unilateral modification power.</p>

<p><strong>With Consent of Holders.</strong> Amendments requiring majority holder consent can modify most terms of the indenture. However, without unanimous consent, no amendment may: reduce principal or interest rates, extend payment dates, change payment currency, impair the right to sue for payment, subordinate the notes or liens, release all or substantially all collateral or guarantees, or reduce the percentage needed for amendments or waivers. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The sacred rights (payment terms, lien priority, guarantee protection) that require unanimous consent are the bedrock protections for minority holders, preventing a majority from sacrificing these fundamental terms in a restructuring deal with the issuer.</p>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of the Holders of at least 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, no amendment or waiver may (A) make any change in any Security Document or the provisions in this Indenture dealing with Collateral or application of trust proceeds of the Collateral with the effect of releasing the Liens on all or substantially all of the Collateral which secure the Secured Notes Obligations or (B) change or alter the priority of the Liens securing the Secured Notes Obligations in any material portion of the Collateral in any way materially adverse, taken as a whole, to the Holders, other than, in each case, as provided under the terms of this Indenture or the Security Documents.
Upon the request of the Company and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 9.06, the Trustee and/or the Notes Collateral Agent shall join with the Company in the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture or security documents or intercreditor agreements (provided, that any such intercreditor agreement may reflect that any additional Indebtedness referenced therein has Liens either senior to or junior to the Secured Notes Obligations or any Consolidated First Lien Debt, as applicable, so long as such Liens are permitted under the Indenture, or any joinder with respect to any of the foregoing) upon the receipt of an Officer’s Certificate stating that such execution and delivery is permitted by the Indenture and all conditions precedent relating to such execution and delivery have been satisfied, unless such amended or supplemental indenture or security documents or intercreditor agreements directly affect the Trustee’s own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental indenture.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
In addition, Holders will be deemed to have consented for purposes of the Security Documents and the applicable Intercreditor Agreements, and the Notes Collateral Agent and the Trustee will be authorized, to amend or supplement the Security Documents or enter into a new intercreditor agreement to add additional secured parties to the extent Liens securing Indebtedness and other Obligations held by such parties are permitted under this Indenture. In executing any such amendment, supplement, joinder, consent or waiver to applicable Intercreditor Agreements or other Security Document or in entering into a new intercreditor agreement or Security Document, the Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to receive and (subject to their duties set forth in this Indenture) shall be fully protected in relying upon an Officer’s Certificate stating that the execution of such amendment, supplement, joinder, consent or waiver or new agreement is authorized or permitted by such Intercreditor Agreement and/or other Security Document, as the case may be, and complies with the provisions thereof and of this Indenture. Notwithstanding anything in this Indenture to the contrary, no opinion of counsel shall be required in connection with the execution by the Trustee or Notes Collateral Agent of any such amendment, supplement, joinder, consent waiver or other modification to any Intercreditor Agreement and/or the other Security Documents or the entering into of a new intercreditor agreement or Security Document.
After an amendment under this Section becomes effective, the Company shall mail to Holders a notice briefly describing such amendment. The failure to give such notice to all Holders, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment under this Section.</div>

<p><strong>Guarantee</strong> establishes the framework for subsidiary guarantees of the Notes. Each Guarantor fully, unconditionally, and irrevocably guarantees all payment obligations under the indenture on a joint and several basis. The guarantees are guarantees of payment (not collection), meaning holders can pursue Guarantors directly without first exhausting remedies against Muvico. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The guarantee structure provides noteholders with claims against multiple entities in the corporate group, not just Muvico. In a restructuring, the breadth of the guarantee pool directly affects recovery prospects.</p>

<p><strong>Guarantee.</strong> Each Guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, jointly and severally, all payment obligations under the Notes (including post-petition interest in bankruptcy). The guarantee is a guarantee of payment, not collection -- holders need not pursue the Company first. The guarantee survives extensions, renewals, and modifications of the obligations. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Joint and several liability means any single Guarantor can be held responsible for the entire outstanding amount. The inclusion of post-petition interest is significant because it strengthens the noteholders' claim in bankruptcy beyond what unsecured creditors receive.</p>

Each Guarantor agrees that the Guarantor Obligations will rank equally in right of payment with other indebtedness of such Guarantor, except to the extent such other Indebtedness is subordinate to the Guarantor Obligations. Each Guarantor further agrees (to the extent permitted by law) that the Guarantor Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound under this Article XI notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guarantor Obligation.
Each Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of payment from and protest to the Company of any of the Guarantor Obligations and also waives notice of protest for non-payment. Each Guarantor waives notice of any default under the Notes or the Guarantor Obligations.
Each Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (and not a guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder to any security held for payment of the Guarantor Obligations.
Except as set forth in Section 11.02, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than payment of the Guarantor Obligations in full), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guarantor Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by (a) the failure of any Holder to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Company or any other person under, this Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal granted; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement; (d) the release of any security held by any Holder or the Trustee for the Guarantor Obligations or any of them; (e) the failure of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy against any other Guarantor; (f) any change in the ownership of the Company; (g) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guarantor Obligations; or (h) any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of such Guarantor as a matter of law or equity.
Each Guarantor agrees that its Guarantee herein shall remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the Guarantor Obligations or such Guarantor is released from its Guarantee in compliance with Section 11.03 hereof. Each Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any of the Guarantor Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise.

Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between such Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the Guarantor Obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in this Indenture for the purposes of its Guarantee herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Guarantor Obligations guaranteed hereby and (y) in the event of any such declaration of acceleration of such Guarantor Obligations, such Guarantor Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantor for the purposes of this Guarantee.
Each Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee or the Holders in enforcing any rights under this Section.</div>

<p><strong>Collateral</strong> governs the security interests that back these notes, including the Security Documents, Intercreditor Agreements, and the Notes Collateral Agent's role. The notes are secured by liens on Muvico's assets at the 1.5L priority level (junior to the $2B Term Loan at 1L and the 1.25L Exchangeable Notes, but senior to the AMC 7.5% Notes at 2L). <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The collateral provisions and their interaction with multiple Intercreditor Agreements determine the actual recovery waterfall in a distressed scenario. The Notes Collateral Agent acts on behalf of holders but is subject to the directions of the Controlling Collateral Agent (the 1L agent) on many matters.</p>

<p><strong>Security Documents.</strong> The Notes are secured by the Collateral as defined in the Security Documents, subject to the Intercreditor Agreements. The Notes Collateral Agent holds the Collateral in trust for holders. Each holder, by accepting a Note, consents to the Security Documents and all Intercreditor Agreements (including the AMC Group First Lien Pari Passu, Muvico Group First Lien/Second Lien, First Lien Priority, and 1.25 Lien Priority Intercreditor Agreements). If an Intercreditor Agreement conflicts with a Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement controls. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The primacy of Intercreditor Agreements means these 1.5L holders' rights are subordinated to higher-priority lien holders in critical matters like foreclosure, collateral releases, and payment distributions.</p>

Subject to the provisions of the Security Documents, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent shall have power to institute and to maintain such suits and proceedings as the Trustee may determine to prevent any impairment of the Collateral by any acts which may be unlawful or in violation of any of the Security Documents or this Indenture, and such suits and proceedings as the Trustee may determine to preserve or protect its interests and the interests of the Holders in the Collateral. Nothing in this Section 12.03 shall be considered to impose any such duty or obligation to act on the part of the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent.</div>

<p><strong>Notes Collateral Agent.</strong> The Notes Collateral Agent is appointed as agent for all holders, with purely ministerial and administrative duties -- no fiduciary or implied obligations. The CSC Delaware Trust Company initially serves as both Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent. The Agent may resign with notice; if no successor is appointed within 30 days, it may petition a court. The Agent may seek holder direction before acting and is not liable for acting on majority holder instructions. Critically, the Agent defers to the Controlling Collateral Agent (1L) and Designated Senior Representative on Muvico Group collateral matters. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The deferral to senior lien holders' agents on collateral decisions means these 1.5L noteholders have limited independent control over their collateral, making the Intercreditor Agreement terms paramount to their actual recovery.</p>

              <div class="legal-text">(a)           The Company and each of the Holders by acceptance of the Notes hereby designates and appoints the Notes Collateral Agent as its agent under this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements, and the Company and each of the Holders by acceptance of the Notes hereby irrevocably authorizes the Notes Collateral Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Notes Collateral Agent by the terms of this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements, and consents and agrees to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreements and each Security Document, as the same may be in effect or may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with their respective terms. The Notes Collateral Agent agrees to act as such on the express conditions contained in this Section 12.08. Each Holder agrees that any action taken by the Notes Collateral Agent in accordance with the provision of this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents, and the exercise by the Notes Collateral Agent of any rights or remedies set forth herein and therein shall be authorized and binding upon all Holders. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements, the duties of the Notes Collateral Agent shall be ministerial and administrative in nature, and the Notes Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, including any duty to monitor, perfect, maintain or enforce any security interest, except those expressly set forth herein and in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements to which the Notes Collateral Agent is a party, nor shall the Notes Collateral Agent have or be deemed to have any trust or other fiduciary relationship with the Trustee, any Holder or any Grantor, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements or otherwise exist against the Notes Collateral Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term “agent” in this Indenture with reference to the Notes Collateral Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.
(b)           The Notes Collateral Agent may perform any of its duties under this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements by or through receivers, agents, employees, attorneys-in-fact or with respect to any specified Person, such Person’s Affiliates, and the respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and attorneys-in-fact of such Person and its Affiliates (a “Related Person”), and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties, and shall be entitled to act upon, and shall be fully protected in taking action in reliance upon any advice or opinion given by legal counsel. The Notes Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any receiver, agent, employee, attorney-in-fact or Related Person that it selects as long as such selection was made in good faith and with due care.
(c)           None of the Notes Collateral Agent or any of its respective Related Persons shall (i) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Indenture or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or under or in connection with any Security Document or the Intercreditor Agreements or the transactions contemplated thereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of the Trustee or any Holder for any recital, statement, representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company or any other Grantor or Affiliate of any Grantor, or any Officer or Related Person thereof, contained in this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Notes Collateral Agent under or in connection with, this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements, or for any failure of any Grantor or any other party to this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. None of the Notes Collateral Agent or any of its respective Related Persons shall be under any obligation to the Trustee or any Holder to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements or to inspect the properties, books, or records of any Grantor or any Grantor’s Affiliates.
(d)           The Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, certification, telephone message, statement, or other communication, document or conversation (including those by telephone or e-mail) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent, or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to the Company or any other Grantor), independent accountants and other experts and advisors selected by the Notes Collateral Agent. The Notes Collateral Agent shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, or other paper or document. The Notes Collateral Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Trustee or the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes as it determines and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Holders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Notes Collateral Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements in accordance with a request, direction, instruction or consent of the Trustee or the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Holders.
(e)           The Notes Collateral Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, unless a Responsible Officer of the Notes Collateral Agent shall have received written notice from the Trustee or the Company referring to this Indenture, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default.” The Notes Collateral Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be requested by the Trustee in accordance with Article VI or the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes (subject to this Section 12.08).
(f)            The Notes Collateral Agent may resign at any time by notice to the Trustee and the Company, such resignation to be effective upon the acceptance of a successor agent to its appointment as Notes Collateral Agent. If the Notes Collateral Agent resigns under this Indenture, the Company shall appoint a successor collateral agent. If no successor collateral agent is appointed prior to the intended effective date of the resignation of the Notes Collateral Agent (as stated in the notice of resignation), the Trustee, at the direction of the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, may appoint a successor collateral agent, subject to the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and which shall not be required during a continuing Event of Default). If no successor collateral agent is appointed and consented to by the Company pursuant to the preceding sentence within thirty (30) days after the intended effective date of resignation (as stated in the notice of resignation) the Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor collateral agent hereunder, such successor collateral agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Notes Collateral Agent, and the term “Notes Collateral Agent” shall mean such successor collateral agent, and the retiring Notes Collateral Agent’s appointment, powers and duties as the Notes Collateral Agent shall be terminated. After the retiring Notes Collateral Agent’s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Section 12.08 shall continue to inure to its benefit and the retiring Notes Collateral Agent shall not by reason of such resignation be deemed to be released from liability as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Notes Collateral Agent under this Indenture.
(g)           The Trustee shall initially act as Notes Collateral Agent and shall be authorized to appoint co-Notes Collateral Agents as necessary in its sole discretion. Except as otherwise explicitly provided herein or in the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements, neither the Notes Collateral Agent nor any of its respective officers, directors, employees or agents or other Related Persons shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part thereof. The Notes Collateral Agent shall be accountable only for amounts that it actually receives as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither the Notes Collateral Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
(h)           The Notes Collateral Agent is authorized and directed to (i) enter into the Security Documents to which it is party, whether executed on or after the Issue Date, (ii) enter into the Intercreditor Agreements, including joinders and supplements thereto, whether executed on or after the Issue Date, (iii) make the representations of the Holders set forth in the Security Documents and Intercreditor Agreements, (iv) bind the Holders on the terms as set forth in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements and (v) perform and observe its obligations under the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements.
(i)            If at any time or times the Trustee shall receive (i) by payment, foreclosure, set-off or otherwise, any proceeds of Collateral or any payments with respect to the Obligations arising under, or relating to, this Indenture, except for any such proceeds or payments received by the Trustee from the Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, or (ii) payments from the Notes Collateral Agent in excess of the amount required to be paid to the Trustee pursuant to Article VI, the Trustee shall promptly turn the same over to the Notes Collateral Agent, in kind, and with such endorsements as may be required to negotiate the same to the Notes Collateral Agent such proceeds to be applied by the Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements.
(j)            The Notes Collateral Agent is each Holder’s agent for the purpose of perfecting the Holders’ security interest in assets which, in accordance with Article IX of the Uniform Commercial Code can be perfected only by possession. Should the Trustee obtain possession of any such Collateral, upon request from the Company, the Trustee shall notify the Notes Collateral Agent thereof and promptly shall deliver such Collateral to the Notes Collateral Agent or otherwise deal with such Collateral in accordance with the Notes Collateral Agent’s instructions.
(k)           The Notes Collateral Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to the Trustee or any of the Holders to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by any Grantor or is cared for, protected, or insured or has been encumbered, or that the Notes Collateral Agent’s Liens have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected, maintained or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to determine whether all of the Grantor’s property constituting Collateral intended to be subject to the Lien and security interest of the Security Documents has been properly and completely listed or delivered, as the case may be, or the genuineness, validity, marketability or sufficiency thereof or title thereto, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities, and powers granted or available to the Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to this Indenture, any Security Document or the Intercreditor Agreements other than pursuant to the instructions of the Trustee or the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes or as otherwise provided in the Security Documents.
(l)            If the Company or any Guarantor (i) incurs any obligations in respect of Junior Priority Obligations at any time when no Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement is in effect and (ii) delivers to the Notes Collateral Agent an Officer’s Certificate so stating and requesting the Notes Collateral Agent to enter into any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement in favor of a designated agent or representative for the holders of the junior priority obligations so incurred, the Notes Collateral Agent shall (and is hereby authorized and directed to) enter into such intercreditor agreement (at the sole expense and cost of AMC, the Company or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors, including legal fees and expenses of the Notes Collateral Agent), bind the Holders on the terms set forth therein and perform and observe its obligations thereunder; provided that neither an Officer’s Certificate nor an Opinion of Counsel shall be required pursuant to this Section 12.08(l) in connection with the applicable Intercreditor Agreements (including pursuant to a joinder thereto) to be entered into.
(m)          No provision of this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements or any Security Document shall require the Notes Collateral Agent (or the Trustee) to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or thereunder or to take or omit to take any action hereunder or thereunder or take any action at the request or direction of Holders (or the Trustee in the case of the Notes Collateral Agent) unless it shall have received indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Notes Collateral Agent and the Trustee against potential costs and liabilities incurred by the Notes Collateral Agent relating thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements or the Security Documents, in the event the Notes Collateral Agent is entitled or required to commence an action to foreclose or otherwise exercise its remedies to acquire control or possession of the Collateral, the Notes Collateral Agent shall not be required to commence any such action or exercise any remedy or to inspect or conduct any studies of any property under the mortgages or take any such other action if the Notes Collateral Agent has determined that the Notes Collateral Agent may incur personal liability as a result of the presence at, or release on or from, the Collateral or such property, of any hazardous substances. The Notes Collateral Agent shall at any time be entitled to cease taking any action described in this clause if it no longer reasonably deems any indemnity, security or undertaking from the Company or the Holders to be sufficient.
(n)           The Notes Collateral Agent (i) shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in connection with this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents or instrument referred to herein or therein, except to the extent that any of the foregoing are found by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its own gross negligence or willful misconduct, (ii) shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Notes Collateral Agent may agree in writing with the Company (and money held in trust by the Notes Collateral Agent need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law) and (iii) may consult with counsel of its selection and the advice or opinion of such counsel as to matters of law shall be full and complete authorization and protection from liability in respect of any action taken, omitted or suffered by it in good faith and in accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel. The grant of permissive rights or powers to the Notes Collateral Agent shall not be construed to impose duties to act.
(o)           Neither the Notes Collateral Agent nor the Trustee shall be liable for delays or failures in performance resulting from acts beyond its control. Such acts shall include but not be limited to acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war, epidemics, governmental regulations superimposed after the fact, fire, communication line failures, computer viruses, power failures, earthquakes or other disasters. Neither the Notes Collateral Agent nor the Trustee shall be liable for any indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages (included but not limited to lost profits) whatsoever, even if it has been informed of the likelihood thereof and regardless of the form of action.
(p)           The Notes Collateral Agent does not assume any responsibility for any failure or delay in performance or any breach by the Company or any other Grantor under this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents. The Notes Collateral Agent shall not be responsible to the Holders or any other Person for any recitals, statements, information, representations or warranties contained in this Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreements or in any certificate, report, statement, or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Notes Collateral Agent under or in connection with, this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements or any Security Document; the execution, validity, genuineness, effectiveness or enforceability of the Intercreditor Agreements and any Security Documents of any other party thereto; the genuineness, enforceability, collectability, value, sufficiency, location or existence of any Collateral, or the validity, effectiveness, enforceability, sufficiency, extent, perfection or priority of any Lien therein; the validity, enforceability or collectability of any Obligations; the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, business, creditworthiness or legal status of any obligor; or for any failure of any obligor to perform its Obligations under this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents. The Notes Collateral Agent shall have no obligation to any Holder or any other Person to ascertain or inquire into the existence of any Default or Event of Default, the observance or performance by any obligor of any terms of this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents, or the satisfaction of any conditions precedent contained in this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements and any Security Documents. The Notes Collateral Agent shall not be required to initiate or conduct any litigation or collection or other proceeding under this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents unless expressly set forth hereunder or thereunder. The Notes Collateral Agent shall have the right at any time to seek instructions from the Holders with respect to the administration of this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements.
(q)           The parties hereto and the Holders hereby agree and acknowledge that neither the Notes Collateral Agent nor the Trustee shall assume, be responsible for or otherwise be obligated for any liabilities, claims, causes of action, suits, losses, allegations, requests, demands, penalties, fines, settlements, damages (including foreseeable and unforeseeable), judgments, expenses and costs (including but not limited to, any remediation, corrective action, response, removal or remedial action, or investigation, operations and maintenance or monitoring costs, for personal injury or property damages, real or personal) of any kind whatsoever, pursuant to any environmental law as a result of this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements, the Security Documents or any actions taken pursuant hereto or thereto. Further, the parties hereto and the Holders hereby agree and acknowledge that in the exercise of its rights under this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents, the Notes Collateral Agent may hold or obtain indicia of ownership primarily to protect the security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent in the Collateral and that any such actions taken by the Notes Collateral Agent shall not be construed as or otherwise constitute any participation in the management of such Collateral. In the event that the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee is required to acquire title to an asset for any reason, or take any managerial action of any kind in regard thereto, in order to carry out any fiduciary or trust obligation for the benefit of another, which in the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee’s sole discretion may cause the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee to be considered an “owner or operator” under the provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), 42 U.S.C. §9601, et seq., or otherwise cause the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee to incur liability under CERCLA or any other federal, state or local law, the Notes Collateral Agent and the Trustee reserves the right, instead of taking such action, to either resign as the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee or arrange for the transfer of the title or control of the asset to a court-appointed receiver. Neither the Notes Collateral Agent nor the Trustee shall be liable to the Company, the Guarantors or any other Person for any environmental claims or contribution actions under any federal, state or local law, rule or regulation by reason of the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee’s actions and conduct as authorized, empowered and directed hereunder or relating to the discharge, release or threatened release of hazardous materials into the environment. If at any time it is necessary or advisable for property to be possessed, owned, operated or managed by any Person (including the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee) other than the Company or the Guarantors, a majority in interest of Holders shall direct the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee to appoint an appropriately qualified Person (excluding the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee) who they shall designate to possess, own, operate or manage, as the case may be, the property.
(r)            Upon the receipt by the Notes Collateral Agent of a written request of the Company signed by an Officer (a “Security Document Order”), the Notes Collateral Agent is hereby authorized to execute and enter into, and shall execute and enter into, without the further consent of any Holder or the Trustee, any Security Document, Intercreditor Agreement or amendment or supplement thereto, to be executed after the Issue Date. Such Security Document Order shall (i) state that it is being delivered to the Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to, and is a Security Document Order referred to in, this Section 12.08(r), and (ii) instruct the Notes Collateral Agent to execute and enter into such Security Document, Intercreditor Agreement or amendment or supplement thereto. Any such execution of a Security Document or amendment or supplement thereto shall be at the direction and expense of the Company, upon delivery to the Notes Collateral Agent of an Officer’s Certificate stating that all conditions precedent to the execution and delivery of the Security Document, Intercreditor Agreement or amendment or supplement thereto have been satisfied. The Holders, by their acceptance of the Notes, hereby authorize and direct the Notes Collateral Agent to execute such Security Documents, Intercreditor Agreement or amendment or supplement thereto.
(s)            Subject to the provisions of the applicable Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements, each Holder, by acceptance of the Notes, agrees that the Notes Collateral Agent shall execute and deliver the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents to which it is a party and all agreements, documents and instruments incidental thereto, and act in accordance with the terms thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the Notes Collateral Agent shall have no discretion under this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements or the Security Documents and shall not be required to make or give any determination, consent, approval, request or direction without the written direction of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes or the Trustee, as applicable.
(t)            After the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee, acting at the direction of the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, may direct the Notes Collateral Agent in connection with any action required or permitted by this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements.
(u)           The Notes Collateral Agent is authorized to receive any funds for the benefit of itself, the Trustee and the Holders distributed under the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements and to the extent not prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreements, for turnover to the Trustee to make further distributions of such funds to itself, the Trustee and the Holders in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.10 and the other provisions of this Indenture.
(v)           In each case that the Notes Collateral Agent may or is required hereunder or under any Security Document or any Intercreditor Agreement to take any action (an “Action”), including without limitation to make any determination, to give consents, to exercise rights, powers or remedies, to release or sell Collateral or otherwise to act hereunder or under any Security Document or any Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes Collateral Agent may seek direction from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes. The Notes Collateral Agent shall not be liable with respect to any Action taken or omitted to be taken by it in accordance with the direction from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes. If the Notes Collateral Agent shall request direction from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes with respect to any Action, the Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such Action unless and until the Notes Collateral Agent shall have received direction from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, and the Notes Collateral Agent shall not incur liability to any Person by reason of so refraining.
(w)          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture or in any Security Document or any Intercreditor Agreement, in no event shall the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee be responsible for, or have any duty or obligation with respect to, the recording, filing, registering, perfection, protection or maintenance of the security interests or Liens intended to be created by this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements (including without limitation the filing or continuation of any UCC financing or continuation statements or similar documents or instruments), nor shall the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee be responsible for, and neither the Notes Collateral Agent nor the Trustee makes any representation regarding, the validity, effectiveness or priority of any of the Security Documents or the security interests or Liens intended to be created thereby.
(x)           Before the Notes Collateral Agent acts or refrains from acting in each case at the request or direction of the Company or the Guarantors, it may require an Officer’s Certificate, which shall conform to the provisions of this Section 12.08 and Sections 13.04 and 13.05; provided that no Officer’s Certificate shall be required in connection with the Security Documents, the AMC Group First Lien Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the Muvico Group First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the Muvico Group First Lien Priority Intercreditor Agreement or the Muvico Group 1.25 Lien Priority Intercreditor Agreement to be entered into by (or otherwise joined by, as applicable) the Notes Collateral Agent on the Issue Date. The Notes Collateral Agent shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on such certificate.
(y)          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Notes Collateral Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary power, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements, and shall solely act pursuant to the instructions of the Holders and the Trustee solely with respect to the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Collateral.
(z)            The rights, privileges, benefits, immunities, indemnities and other protections given to the Trustee are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Notes Collateral Agent as if the Notes Collateral Agent were named as the Trustee herein and the Security Documents and Intercreditor Agreements were named as this Indenture herein.
(aa)          The Company and the Guarantors shall furnish to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (beginning with the first fiscal year ending after the Issue Date and after giving effect to any fiscal year end change effected on or after the Issue Date), an Officer’s Certificate (which may be the same certificate required to be delivered by the Company pursuant to Section 4.13) either (i) (x) stating that such action has been taken with respect to the recording, filing, re-recording, and refiling of this Indenture or the Security Documents, as applicable, as are necessary to maintain the perfected Liens of the applicable Security Documents securing the Secured Notes Obligations under applicable law to the extent required by the Security Documents other than any action as described therein to be taken, and (y) stating that on the date of such Officer’s Certificate, all financing statements, financing statement amendments and continuation statements have been or will be executed and filed that are necessary, as of such date or promptly thereafter and during the succeeding 12 months, fully to maintain the perfection (to the extent required by the Security Documents) of the security interests of the Notes Collateral Agent securing the Obligations thereunder and under the Security Documents with respect to the Collateral; provided that if there is a required filing of a continuation statement or other instrument within such 12-month period and such continuation statement or amendment is not effective if filed at the time of the Officer’s Certificate, such Officer’s Certificate may so state and in that case the Company and the Guarantors shall cause a continuation statement or amendment to be timely filed and become effective so as to maintain such Liens and security interests securing the Secured Notes Obligations or (ii) stating that no such action is necessary to maintain such Liens or security interests.</div>

<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong> contains standard boilerplate provisions including notice procedures, communication rights, certificate and opinion requirements, governing law (New York), no-recourse limitations, successors, severability, and the PATRIOT Act provision. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> While largely procedural, the governing law provision (New York) is significant because New York law generally favors strict enforcement of contract terms and has the most developed body of indenture case law.</p>

The Company or the Trustee by notice to the other may designate additional or different addresses for subsequent notices or communications. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to the Holder at the Holder’s address as it appears on the registration books of the Registrar and shall be sufficiently given if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it.
All notices, approvals, consents, requests and any communications under this Indenture must be in writing (provided that any communication sent to the Trustee must be in the form of a document that is signed manually or by way of a digital signature provided by DocuSign (or such other digital signature provider as specified in writing to the Trustee by the Company)), in English.

Rule 144A Notes shall be issued initially in the form of one or more permanent global notes in fully registered form (the “Rule 144A Global Note”) and Regulation S Notes shall be issued initially in the form of one or more global notes in fully registered form (the “Temporary Regulation S Global Note”) and, following the termination of the Distribution Compliance Period the Temporary Regulation S Global Notes shall be exchanged for permanent global notes in fully registered form (the “Permanent Regulation S Global Note” and, together with the Temporary Regulation S Global Notes, the “Regulation S Global Notes”), in each case without interest coupons and bearing the Global Notes Legend and Restricted Notes Legend, which shall be deposited on behalf of the purchasers of the Notes represented thereby with the Securities Custodian, and registered in the name of the Depository or a nominee of the Depository for the accounts of designated agents holding on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, duly executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee as provided in this Indenture. The Rule 144A Global Note and the Regulation S Global Note are each referred to herein as a “Global Note” and are collectively referred to herein as “Global Notes.” The aggregate principal amount of the Global Notes may from time to time be increased or decreased by adjustments made on the records of the Trustee and the Depository or its nominees and on the schedules thereto as hereinafter provided.
(c)           Book-Entry Provisions. This Section 2.1(c) shall apply only to a Global Note deposited with or on behalf of the Depository.

(ii)            to exchange such Definitive Notes for an equal principal amount of Definitive Notes of other authorized denominations, the Registrar or co-registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested if its reasonable requirements for such transaction are met; provided, however, that the Definitive Notes surrendered for transfer or exchange:
(1)            shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar or co-registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or such Holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing; and

(A)           if such Definitive Notes are being delivered to the Registrar by a Holder for registration in the name of such Holder, without transfer, a certification from such Holder to that effect; or
(B)           if such Definitive Notes are being transferred to the Company, a certification to that effect; or
(C)           if such Definitive Notes are being transferred pursuant to an exemption from registration in accordance with Rule 144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act or pursuant to or in compliance with an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act other than Rule 144, Rule 903 or Rule 904, (i) a certification to that effect and (ii) if the Company so requests, an opinion of counsel or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to it as to compliance with the restrictions set forth in the legend set forth in Section 2.3(e)(i).

A-4
(i)             certification (in the form set forth on the reverse side of the Note) that such Definitive Note is being (A) transferred (1) to a QIB in accordance with Rule 144A, (2) outside the United States in an offshore transaction within the meaning of Regulation S and in compliance with Rule 904 under the Securities Act, which certification shall be accompanied by a signed letter substantially in the form of Exhibit B, (3) pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act, (4) pursuant to an available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act other than those in (1)-(3) above, or (5) to AMC or a Subsidiary of the Company or (B) exchanged for a beneficial interest in a Global Note; and
(ii)            written instructions directing the Trustee to make, or directing the Securities Custodian to make, an adjustment on its books and records with respect to such Global Note to reflect an increase in the aggregate principal amount of the Note represented by the Global Note, such instructions to contain information regarding the Depository account to be credited with such increase,
then the Trustee shall cancel such Definitive Note and cause, or direct the Securities Custodian to cause, in accordance with the standing instructions and procedures existing between the Depository and the Securities Custodian, the aggregate principal amount of Notes represented by the Global Note to be increased by the aggregate principal amount of the Definitive Note to be exchanged and shall credit or cause to be credited to the account of the Person specified in such instructions a beneficial interest in the Global Note equal to the principal amount of the Definitive Note so canceled. If no Global Notes are then outstanding and the Global Note has not been previously exchanged for certificated securities pursuant to Section 2.4, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate, upon written order of the Company in the form of an Officer’s Certificate, a new Global Note in the appropriate principal amount.
(c)            Transfer and Exchange of Global Notes.
(i)             The transfer and exchange of Global Notes or beneficial interests therein shall be effected through the Depository in accordance with this Indenture (including applicable restrictions on transfer set forth herein, if any) and the procedures of the Depository therefor. A transferor of a beneficial interest in a Global Note shall deliver to the Registrar a written order given in accordance with the procedures of the Depository containing information regarding the participant account of the Depository to be credited with a beneficial interest in the Global Note and such account shall be credited in accordance with such instructions with a beneficial interest in the Global Note and the account of the Person making the transfer shall be debited by an amount equal to the beneficial interest in the Global Note being transferred. Transfers by an owner of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note to a transferee who takes delivery of such interest through the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, shall be made only upon receipt by the Trustee of a certification in the form provided on the reverse of the Notes from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or (if available) Rule 144 under the Securities Act or pursuant to or in compliance with an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act other than Rule 144, Rule 903 or Rule 904 and that, if such transfer is being made prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, the interest transferred shall be held immediately thereafter through Euroclear or Clearstream.
A-5
(ii)            If the proposed transfer is a transfer of a beneficial interest in one Global Note to a beneficial interest in another Global Note, the Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date and an increase in the principal amount of the Global Note to which such interest is being transferred in an amount equal to the principal amount of the interest to be so transferred, and the Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date and a corresponding decrease in the principal amount of Global Note from which such interest is being transferred.
(iii)           Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Exhibit A (other than the provisions set forth in Section 2.4), a Global Note may not be transferred as a whole except by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository or by the Depository or any such nominee to a successor depository or a nominee of such successor depository.
(iv)           In the event that a Global Note is exchanged for Notes in definitive registered form pursuant to Section 2.4, such Notes may be exchanged only in accordance with such procedures as are substantially consistent with the provisions of this Section 2.3 (including the certification requirements set forth on the reverse, of the Notes intended to ensure that such transfers comply with Rule 144A, Regulation S or such other applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act, as the case may be) and such other procedures as may from time to time be adopted by the Company.
(d)           Restrictions on Transfer of Regulation S Global Note. (i) Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, interests in the Regulation S Global Note may only be held through Euroclear or Clearstream. During the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial ownership interests in the Regulation S Global Note may only be sold, pledged or transferred through Euroclear or Clearstream in accordance with the Applicable Procedures and only (1) so long as such security is eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person whom the selling holder reasonably believes is a QIB that purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the resale, pledge or transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (2) in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S, (3) pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act provided by Rule 144 (if applicable) under the Securities Act, or (4) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, in each case in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States. Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, transfers by an owner of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note to a transferee who takes delivery of such interest through the Rule 144A Global Note shall be made only in accordance with Applicable Procedures and upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification from the transferor of the beneficial interest in the form provided on the reverse of the Notes (as set forth in Appendix I hereto) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A. Such written certification shall no longer be required after the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period.
A-6
(ii)            Upon the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial ownership interests in the Regulation S Global Note shall be transferable in accordance with applicable law and the other terms of this Indenture.
(e)            Legend.
(i)             Except as permitted by the following paragraphs (ii) and (iii), each certificate evidencing the Global Notes and the Definitive Notes and the Regulation S Global Note (prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period) (and all Notes issued in exchange therefor or in substitution thereof), shall bear a legend in substantially the following form (each defined term in the legend being defined as such for purposes of the legend only):

AS USED HEREIN, THE TERMS “OFFSHORE TRANSACTION,” “UNITED STATES” AND “U.S. PERSON” HAVE THE MEANING GIVEN TO THEM BY REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT.
A-7
Prior to the Distribution Compliance Period, each Regulation S Global Note will also bear the following additional legend:
THIS SECURITY (OR ITS PREDECESSOR) WAS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION ORIGINALLY EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED IN THE UNITED STATES OR TO, OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OR BENEFIT OF, ANY U.S. PERSON EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND ALL APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. TERMS USED ABOVE HAVE THE MEANINGS GIVEN TO THEM IN REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT.
Each Definitive Note will also bear the following additional legend:

Senior Secured Note due 2029
1.             Interest.
Muvico, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (the “Company”), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Rate as in effect from time to time. The Company will pay interest semiannually, in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing December 15, 2025, in immediately available funds in cash and, to the extent set forth in the Applicable Rate, in kind (“PIK Interest”). Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the Issue Date. Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Company shall have the option, at its election, to pay the Additional Rate, if applicable, on the Notes in either cash (“Cash Interest”) or PIK Interest. To elect PIK Interest for an interest payment period in respect of the Additional Rate, the Company shall deliver a written notice to the Trustee and the Holders prior to the fifteenth (15th) calendar day immediately prior to the interest payment date for such interest payment period, which notice shall state the form of interest payment with respect the Additional Rate, if applicable, to such interest period and the total amount of interest to be paid on such interest payment date (a “PIK Election”). If a PIK Election is made in accordance with the previous sentence, such PIK Interest and any other applicable PIK Interest shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.14 of the Indenture (each a “PIK Payment”). In the event that the Company does not make a timely PIK Election with respect to the Additional Rate, if applicable, for an interest payment period, then the Company shall pay the Additional Rate in Cash Interest for such interest payment period.
2.             Method of Payment
The Company will pay interest on the Notes (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered holders of Notes at the Close of Business on the June 1 or December 1 next preceding the applicable interest payment date even if the Notes are canceled after the record date and on or before the interest payment date. Holders must surrender the Notes to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments.

Cash payments in respect of the Notes represented by a Global Note (including principal, premium and interest) will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by The Depository Trust Company (the “Depository”). The Company will make all cash payments in respect of a certificated Note (including principal, premium and interest) by mailing a check to the registered address of each Holder thereof; provided, however, that cash payments on the Notes may also be made, in the case of a Holder of at least $2,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes, by wire transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States if such Holder elects payment by wire transfer by giving written notice to the Trustee or the Paying Agent to such effect designating such account no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may accept in its discretion).

These limitations are subject to significant exceptions set forth in the Indenture.

In addition, if such redemption or purchase is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Company’s discretion, the redemption date or purchase date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase was mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the redemption date or purchase date or by the redemption date or purchase date as so delayed, or such notice or offer may be rescinded at any time in the Company’s discretion if the Company reasonably believes that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Notes are registered at the Close of Business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Company.

Exhibit C
FORM OF SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE TO ADD GUARANTORS
This Supplemental Indenture, dated as of [______], 20 (this “Supplemental Indenture”) among [name of future Guarantor] (the “Subsidiary Guarantor”), a subsidiary of Muvico, LLC (together with its successors and assigns, the “Company”) or AMC (as applicable) and CSC Delaware Trust Company, as Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent under the Indenture referred to below.
W I T N E S S E T H:
WHEREAS, the Company, AMC, the Guarantors and the Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent have heretofore executed and delivered an Indenture, dated as of July 24, 2025 (as amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified, the “Indenture”) providing for the issuance of Senior Secured Notes due 2029 of the Company (the “Notes”);
WHEREAS, Section 4.10 of the Indenture provides that under certain circumstances the Subsidiary Guarantor shall execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Subsidiary Guarantor will unconditionally guarantee, on a joint and several basis with the other Guarantors, the full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and all other obligations and liabilities of the Company under this
Indenture on the terms and conditions set forth herein and under the Indenture (the “Subsidiary Guarantee”); and
WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 9.01 of the Indenture, the Trustee, the Company and the Guarantors are authorized to execute and deliver this Supplemental Indenture to amend or supplement the Indenture, without the consent of any Holder;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Subsidiary Guarantor, the Company, the other Guarantors and the Trustee mutually covenant and agree for the equal and ratable benefit of the Holders of the Notes as follows:</div>

<p><strong>Definitions and Rules of Construction.</strong> This article establishes the defined terms used throughout the indenture, rules of construction for interpreting the document, and provisions for Limited Condition Transactions and compliance determinations. Section 1.01 alone contains hundreds of defined terms that control how every other provision is interpreted. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The definitions effectively set the boundaries for every covenant and restriction in the indenture; creative drafting of definitions (like "Permitted Investments" or "Permitted Liens") can dramatically expand or contract what the issuer is allowed to do.</p>

<p><strong>The Notes</strong> covers the mechanics of the notes themselves: issuance, form, authentication, transfer, interest computation, and the critical PIK interest mechanism. The aggregate principal amount is unlimited, meaning Muvico can issue Additional Notes subject to covenant compliance. Interest is computed on a 360-day year basis. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The PIK interest provisions in Section 2.14 are the engine that allows Muvico's debt to compound when leverage is high, increasing the principal amount of outstanding notes without any cash payment.</p>
