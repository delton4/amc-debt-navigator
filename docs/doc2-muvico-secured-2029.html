            <div class="raw-section">In connection with any action being taken solely in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction, for purposes of:
(i)            determining compliance with any provision of this Indenture which requires the calculation of any financial ratio;
(ii)           determining whether a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or any subset of Defaults or Events of Default); or
(iii)          testing availability under baskets set forth in this Indenture (including baskets measured as a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Total Assets); in each case, at the option of the Company (the Company’s election to exercise such option in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction, an “LCT Election”), with such option to be exercised on or prior to the date of execution of the definitive agreements related to such Limited Condition Transaction, the date of determination of whether any such action is permitted hereunder, shall be deemed to be the date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Transaction are entered into (the “LCT Test Date”), and if, after giving Pro Forma Effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they had occurred at the beginning of the most recent Test Period ending prior to the LCT Test Date, the Company could have taken such action on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio or basket, such ratio or basket shall be deemed to have been complied with.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company has made an LCT Election and any of the ratios or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio or basket, including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the Company or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or action, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations; however, if any ratios improve or baskets increase as a result of such fluctuations, such improved ratios or baskets may be utilized. If the Company has made an LCT Election for any Limited Condition Transaction, then in connection with any subsequent calculation of the incurrence ratios subject to the LCT Election on or following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of (i) the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or (ii) the date that the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated or expires without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio or basket shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming such Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated.</div>

(b)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any test or utilization of any basket contained in this Indenture, Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Total Assets, the Total Leverage Ratio or the First Lien Leverage Ratio shall be calculated on a Pro Forma Basis to give effect to all Specified Transactions (including the Transactions) that have been made during the applicable period of measurement or subsequent to such period and prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation is made and to the extent the proceeds of any new Indebtedness are to be used to repay other Indebtedness (including by repurchase, redemption, retirement, extinguishment, defeasance, discharge or pursuant to escrow or similar arrangements) no later than 60 days following the incurrence of such new Indebtedness, the Company shall be permitted to give Pro Forma Effect to such repayment of Indebtedness.
(c)           For purposes of determining the permissibility of any action, change, transaction or event that requires a calculation of any financial ratio or test (including, without limitation, any First Lien Leverage Ratio test and/or any Total Leverage Ratio test, the amount of Consolidated EBITDA and/or Consolidated Total Assets), such financial ratio or test shall be calculated at the time such action is taken (subject to Section 1.05), such change is made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the case may be, and no Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of a change in such financial ratio or test occurring after the time such action is taken, such change is made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the case may be.
(d)           Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for purposes of any determination under this Indenture expressly requiring the use of a current exchange rate, all amounts incurred, outstanding or proposed to be incurred or outstanding in currencies other than dollars shall be translated into dollars at the Spot Rate (or, if such determination is calculated under the Term Loan Credit Agreement at the Exchange Rate, such Exchange Rate) (rounded to the nearest currency unit, with 0.5 or more of a currency unit being rounded upward); provided, however, that for purposes of determining compliance with respect to the amount of any Indebtedness, Investment, Disposition or Restricted Payment in a currency other than dollars, no Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of changes in rates of exchange occurring after the time such Indebtedness or Investment is incurred or Disposition or Restricted Payment made; provided, further, that, for the avoidance of doubt, this Section 1.06 shall otherwise apply to such provisions, including with respect to determining whether any Indebtedness or Investment may be incurred or Disposition or Restricted Payment made at any time under such provisions. For purposes of any determination of Consolidated Total Debt, amounts in currencies other than dollars shall be translated into dollars at the currency exchange rates used in preparing the most recently delivered financial statements pursuant to Section 4.12 (or, prior to the first such delivery, the most recent internally available financial statements).</div>

All Notes issued under this Indenture shall be treated as a single class for all purposes of this Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase.
Subject to Section 2.03, the Trustee shall authenticate the Initial Notes for original issue on the Issue Date in the aggregate principal amount of $856,964,000. With respect to any Additional Notes issued after the Issue Date (except for Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for, or in lieu of, Initial Notes pursuant to Section 2.07, 2.09 or 3.06 or Exhibit A), there shall be established in or pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors, and subject to Section 2.03, set forth, or determined in the manner provided in an Officer’s Certificate, or established in one or more indentures supplemental hereto, prior to the issuance of such Additional Notes:
(a)           whether such Additional Notes shall be issued as part of a new or existing series of Notes and the title of such Additional Notes (which shall distinguish the Additional Notes of the series from Notes of any other series);
(b)           the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes that may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture (which shall be calculated without reference to any Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Notes of the same series pursuant to Section 2.07, 2.09 or 3.06 or Exhibit A or any Notes which, pursuant to Section 2.03, are deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder);
(c)           the issue price and issuance date of such Additional Notes, including the date from which interest on such Additional Notes shall accrue; and
(d)           if applicable, that such Additional Notes shall be issuable in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Notes and, in such case, the respective depositories for such Global Notes, the form of any legend or legends that shall be borne by any such Global Notes in addition to or in lieu of that set forth in Appendix I to Exhibit A and any circumstances in addition to or in lieu of those set forth in Section 2.3 of Exhibit A in which any such Global Notes may be exchanged in whole or in part for Additional Notes registered, and any transfer of such Global Notes in whole or in part may be registered, in the name or names of Persons other than the depository for such Global Note or a nominee thereof.
If any of the terms of any Additional Notes are established by action taken pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officer’s Certificate or the trust indenture supplemental hereto setting forth the terms of the Additional Notes.</div>

If the Officer whose signature is on a Note no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note, the Note shall be valid nevertheless.
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver (i) Additional Notes and (ii) PIK Notes executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a written order of the Company in the form of an Officer’s Certificate for the authentication and delivery of such Additional Notes or PIK Notes, as applicable, and the Trustee in accordance with such written order of the Company shall authenticate and deliver such Notes.
A Note shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the Note. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Note has been authenticated under this Indenture.
The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to authenticate the Notes. Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Notes whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as any Registrar, Paying Agent or agent for service of notices and demands.
The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Notes if the issue thereof will adversely affect the Trustee’s own rights, duties, indemnities or immunities under the Notes and this Indenture.</div>

            <div class="raw-section">The Company shall maintain an office or agency where Notes may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (the “Registrar”) and an office or agency where Notes may be presented for payment (the “Paying Agent”). The Registrar shall keep a register of the Notes and of their transfer and exchange. The Company may have one or more registrars for so long as the Notes are held in registered form, and one or more co-registrars. The initial Paying Agent will be CSC Delaware Trust Company, in New York.
The initial Registrar and transfer agent for the Notes will be CSC Delaware Trust Company in New York.
The Registrars and the transfer agents will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Notes in the form of Definitive Notes (as defined in Exhibit A) outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive Notes on behalf of the Company. Each transfer agent shall perform the functions of a transfer agent.
The Company may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders of the Notes.
The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Registrar, Paying Agent or transfer agent not a party to this Indenture. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such agent. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the name and address of any such agent. If the Company fails to maintain a Registrar, Paying Agent or transfer agent, the Trustee shall act as such and shall be entitled to appropriate compensation therefor pursuant to Section 7.07. AMC or any of its domestic Wholly Owned Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent in respect of the Notes.</div>

The Company shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that such Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or the Trustee all money held by such Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or interest on the Notes and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Company or any Guarantor in making any such payment. If the Company or a domestic Wholly Owned Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund.

The Trustee and no one else shall cancel (subject to the record retention requirements of the Exchange Act), in accordance with the Trustee’s customary procedures, all Notes surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment or cancellation and deliver cancelled Notes to the Company upon a written direction of the Company. Except as expressly permitted herein, the Company may not issue new Notes to replace Notes it has redeemed, paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
If the Company or any Guarantor acquires any of the Notes, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the Indebtedness represented by such Notes unless and until the same are surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to this Section 2.10. The Company may not issue new Notes to replace Notes it has paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for any reason other than in connection with a registration of transfer or exchange of such Notes.
At such time as all beneficial interests in a Global Note have either been exchanged for definitive Notes, transferred, redeemed, repurchased or canceled, such Global Note shall be returned by the Securities Custodian with respect to such Global Note to the Trustee for cancellation or retained and canceled by the Trustee. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any beneficial interest in a Global Note is exchanged for definitive Notes, transferred in exchange for an interest in another Global Note, redeemed, repurchased or canceled, the principal amount of Notes represented by such Global Note shall be reduced and an adjustment shall be made on the books and records of the Trustee (if it is then the Securities Custodian for such Global Note) with respect to such Global Note, by the Trustee or the Securities Custodian, to reflect such reduction.</div>

Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a record date (the “Special Record Date”) for the payment of such defaulted interest, which date shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the Special Interest Payment Date and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date, and in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such defaulted interest and the Special Record Date and Special Interest Payment Date therefor to be given in the manner provided for in Section 13.02, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such defaulted interest and the Special Record Date and Special Interest Payment Date therefor having been so given, such defaulted interest shall be paid on the Special Interest Payment Date to the Persons in whose names the Notes (or their respective predecessor Notes) are registered at the Close of Business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable.
The Company may make payment of any defaulted interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.

            <div class="raw-section">(a)           Unless previously redeemed, each Note will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Rate, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash and, to the extent provided in the Applicable Rate, in payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing December 15, 2025, to the Persons in whose names the Notes are registered in the security register for the Notes at the close of business on June 1 or December 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such applicable interest payment date. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, the date of issuance of such Notes (including Additional Notes).
(b)           If the Additional Rate is payable and the Company elects to pay it in PIK interest for an interest payment period, the Company shall deliver a written notice to the Trustee and the Holders prior to the fifteenth (15th) calendar day immediately prior to the interest payment date for such interest payment period, which notice shall state the form of interest payment with respect to such interest period and the total amount of interest to be paid on such interest payment date (a “PIK Election”). If a PIK Election is made in accordance with the previous sentence, such PIK interest shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.14(c). In the event that the Company does not make a timely PIK Election in accordance with this clause (b) for an interest payment period, then the Company shall be deemed to have elected to pay the Additional Rate, if applicable, in cash.
(c)           PIK interest on the Notes, if applicable, will be payable (x) with respect to Notes represented by one or more Global Notes registered in the name of, or held by, the Depository or its nominee on the relevant record date, by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding Global Note by an amount equal to the amount of PIK interest for the applicable interest period (rounded up to the nearest whole dollar) and (y) with respect to Notes not represented by Global Notes, by issuing Notes (rounded up to the nearest whole dollar) (“PIK Notes”), having the same terms and conditions as the Notes, in certificated form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the amount of PIK interest for the applicable period, and the Trustee will, at the request of the Company, authenticate and deliver such PIK Notes for original issuance to applicable Holders on the relevant record date, as shown by the records of the register of Holders. Following an increase in the principal amount of the outstanding Global Notes as a result of a payment of PIK interest, the Global Notes will bear interest on such increased principal amount from and after the date of such payment of PIK interest. Any PIK Notes issued in certificated form will be dated as of the applicable interest payment date and will bear interest from and after such date. All Notes issued pursuant to a payment of PIK interest will mature on the Maturity Date and will be governed by, and subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of this Indenture and shall have the same rights and benefits as the Notes issued on the Issue Date. Any certificated PIK Notes will be issued with the description “PIK” on the face of such PIK Note, and references to the “principal” or “principal amount” of the PIK Notes shall include any increase in the principal amount of the outstanding Notes as a result of any payment of PIK interest.
The calculation of PIK interest will be made by the Company or on behalf of the Company by such Person as the Company shall designate, and such calculation and verifying the correctness thereof shall not be a duty or obligation of the Trustee. Notwithstanding anything in this Indenture or the Notes to the contrary, the payment of accrued and unpaid interest (including interest that would otherwise be PIK interest when paid) in connection with any redemption of Notes as described in paragraph 6 of the Notes or Section 3.07 shall, in each case, be made solely in cash. PIK interest on the Notes will be paid in denominations of $1.00 and integral multiples of $1.00 in excess thereof.</div>

<p><strong>The Covenants</strong> are the core restrictions on what Muvico and AMC can do while these notes are outstanding. They limit new debt, restrict dividends and payments to equity holders, cap liens on assets, and control transactions with affiliates. For this instrument, the <strong>leverage-based interest rate grid</strong> is critical: the higher the Total Leverage Ratio, the more interest shifts from cash to PIK, growing the debt pile.</p>
<p>The interest rate structure is:
<strong>Base rate:</strong> 7.50% cash, plus incremental amounts based on leverage:
Level 1 (>= 7.50x leverage): +1.50% cash, +6.00% PIK = <strong>15% total</strong>;
Level 2 (6.50-7.50x): +2.375% cash, +2.375% PIK = <strong>12.25% total</strong>;
Level 3 (< 6.50x): +4.00% cash only = <strong>11.50% total</strong>.
At current ~19.4x Muvico leverage, these notes are firmly in Level 1, paying 9% cash + 6% PIK.</p>

<p><strong>Limitation on Indebtedness</strong> restricts Muvico from taking on additional debt beyond specified baskets. The Company cannot incur new Indebtedness unless, after giving pro forma effect, the <strong>Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio</strong> is at least 2.00:1.00 (or another specified ratio). There are extensive carve-outs for: refinancing existing debt, capital leases, intercompany loans, and permitted incremental facilities. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> With current leverage at ~19.4x, Muvico is deeply restricted from incurring new debt outside the carved-out baskets. Any new financing would need to fit within specific exceptions rather than the general incurrence test.</p>

<p><strong>Limitation on Restricted Payments</strong> prevents Muvico/AMC from paying dividends, buying back stock, or making distributions to equity holders while these notes are outstanding. The general basket requires the Company to satisfy a Coverage Ratio test and caps cumulative restricted payments at a builder basket that grows with 50% of cumulative Consolidated Net Income. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> This is a critical protection for noteholders - it prevents the company from bleeding cash out to shareholders while creditors remain at risk. Given AMC's distressed leverage, this covenant is likely already binding.</p>

<p><strong>Limitation on Liens</strong> prevents Muvico from pledging its assets as collateral for other debt beyond what is already permitted. Permitted liens include: existing liens, liens securing the Term Loan and other first-priority debt, purchase money liens (capped), and general baskets for smaller amounts. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Since these notes have 1.5L priority at Muvico (junior to the $2B Term Loan), this covenant prevents Muvico from creating additional senior or pari passu liens that would further dilute these noteholders' collateral position.</p>

<p><strong>Limitation on Affiliate Transactions</strong> requires that any transaction between the Company and its affiliates be conducted on <strong>arm's-length terms</strong> (i.e., terms no less favorable than would be obtained from an unrelated third party). Transactions above $15 million require Board approval; transactions above $50 million require a fairness opinion or independent appraisal. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> This prevents AMC or insiders from extracting value from Muvico through sweetheart deals, management fees, or intercompany transfers that benefit equity at creditors' expense.</p>

<p><strong>Asset Sales</strong> restricts Muvico from selling assets unless: (1) the consideration is at least <strong>fair market value</strong>, (2) at least <strong>75% of consideration is cash or cash equivalents</strong>, and (3) Net Proceeds are applied within 365 days to either reinvest in the business or repay senior secured debt. If Net Proceeds exceed a threshold and are not applied, Muvico must make an <strong>Excess Proceeds Offer</strong> to repurchase notes at par. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> This prevents the company from selling off valuable theatre assets and using the cash for other purposes (like paying dividends or servicing junior debt) without first giving these noteholders a chance to be repaid.</p>

              <div class="legal-text">(a)            If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(e) or (f)) occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee, by notice to the Company, or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding, by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, all the Notes to be due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(e) or (f) occurs and is continuing, then the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, all the Notes shall automatically become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. The Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Notes if in the reasonable judgment of the Trustee, acceleration is not in the interest of the Holders.
(b)           At any time after a declaration of acceleration has been made, but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as provided hereinafter in this Article VI, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
(i)             the Company has paid or deposited, or caused to be paid or deposited, with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:
(A)          all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel;
(B)           all overdue interest on all Notes;
(C)           the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Notes that has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate borne by the Notes; and
(D)           to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate borne by the Notes; and
(ii)            all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of principal of the Notes which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 6.04.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
(c)           In the event of any Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(d), such Event of Default and all consequences thereof shall be automatically annulled if, within ten (10) Business Days after such Event of Default arose, the Company delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that (x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged, (y) the holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default or (z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured, it being understood that in no event shall an acceleration of the principal amount of the Notes as described above be annulled, waived or rescinded upon the happening of any such events.
(d)           If the Notes are accelerated or otherwise become due prior to their stated maturity (including the acceleration of any portion of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes by operation of law), the amount that shall then be due and payable shall be equal to:
(i)             (A) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding plus the Applicable Premium in effect on the date of such acceleration, or (B) the applicable redemption price in effect on the date of such acceleration, as applicable,
plus
(ii)           accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of such acceleration,
in each case as if such acceleration were an optional redemption of the Notes so accelerated.
(e)            Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, if the Notes are accelerated or otherwise become due prior to their stated maturity (including the acceleration of any portion of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes by operation of law), the Applicable Premium shall also be due and payable as though the Notes had been optionally redeemed on the date of such acceleration and shall constitute part of the obligations with respect to the Notes in view of the impracticability and difficulty of ascertaining actual damages and by mutual agreement of the parties as to a reasonable calculation of each holder’s lost profits as a result thereof. If the Applicable Premium becomes due and payable, it shall be deemed to be principal of the Notes and interest shall accrue on the full principal amount of the Notes (including the Applicable Premium or the Redemption Price Premium, as applicable) from and after the applicable triggering event. Any premium payable pursuant to this paragraph shall be presumed to be liquidated damages sustained by each Holder as the result of the acceleration of the Notes, and the Company agrees that it is reasonable under the circumstances currently existing. The premium shall also be payable in the event the Notes or this Indenture are satisfied, released or discharged through foreclosure, whether by judicial proceeding, deed in lieu of foreclosure or by any other means. THE COMPANY AND EACH GUARANTOR EXPRESSLY WAIVES (TO THE FULLEST EXTENT IT MAY LAWFULLY DO SO) THE PROVISIONS OF ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE STATUTE OR LAW THAT PROHIBITS OR MAY PROHIBIT THE COLLECTION OF THE FOREGOING PREMIUM IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH ACCELERATION. The Company expressly agrees (to the fullest extent it may lawfully do so) that: (A) the premium is reasonable and is the product of an arm’s length transaction between sophisticated business entities ably represented by counsel; (B) the premium shall be payable notwithstanding the then prevailing market rates at the time acceleration occurs; (C) there has been a course of conduct between the Holders and the Company giving specific consideration in this transaction for such agreement to pay the premium; and (D) the Company shall be estopped hereafter from claiming differently than as agreed to in this paragraph. The Company expressly acknowledges that its agreement to pay the premium to the Holders as herein described is a material inducement to the Holders to purchase the Notes.</div>

(b)           Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:
(i)             the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
(ii)            in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, and will be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein).
(c)           The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own grossly negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:
(i)             this clause (c) does not limit the effect of clause (b) of this Section 7.01;
(ii)            the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Trust Officer unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and

(d)           Every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to clauses (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 7.01.
(e)           The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Company.
(f)            Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
(g)           No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers.
(h)           The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a Trust Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Notes and this Indenture.
(i)             For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee’s duties hereunder shall be strictly limited to those expressly set forth in this Indenture, and this Indenture shall not be interpreted to impose any implied fiduciary or other duties or obligations on the Trustee.</div>

(a)           The Trustee may rely on any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper person. The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document. The Trustee may, however, in its discretion make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney.
(b)           Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officer’s Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on the Officer’s Certificate or Opinion of Counsel.
(c)            The Trustee may act through agents and shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed with due care.
(d)           The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith that it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers; provided, however, that the Trustee’s conduct does not constitute willful misconduct or negligence.
(e)           The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders, unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee, to the extent satisfactory to the Trustee, security or indemnity against the loss, liability or expense (including attorneys’ fees) that might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction. If the Trustee requests direction from the Holders, the Trustee is entitled to refrain from taking action unless and until the Trustee shall have received direction from the Holders, and the Trustee shall not incur any liability to any Person based upon any action omitted to be taken by it in connection with this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents or instrument referred to herein or therein.
(f)            In no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for special, indirect, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, loss of profit) irrespective of whether the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.
(g)           The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a Trust Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Notes and this Indenture.
(h)           The Trustee shall not be required to give a note, bond or surety in respect of the trusts and powers under this Indenture.
(i)            The Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection, and the advice or opinion of counsel with respect to legal matters relating to this Indenture and the Notes shall be full and complete authorization and protection from liability in respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel.
(j)            Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Indenture, any demand, request, direction or notice from the Company shall be sufficient if signed by an Officer of the Company.

A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Holders shall be filed with the SEC and each stock exchange (if any) on which the Notes are listed.

            <div class="raw-section">The Company shall pay to the Trustee (acting in any capacity hereunder) and any predecessor Trustee from time to time such compensation for its services as shall from time to time be agreed to in writing by the Company and the Trustee. The Trustee’s compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for all documented expenses incurred or made by it, including costs of collection, in addition to the compensation for its services. Such expenses shall include the documented compensation and expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee’s agents, counsel, accountants and experts. The Company shall indemnify the Trustee (acting in any capacity hereunder) against any and all loss, liability or expense (including documented attorneys’ fees) incurred by it in connection with the acceptance and administration of this trust and the performance of its duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not reimburse any expenses or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee’s own willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith. The Company need not pay for any settlement made by the Trustee without the Company’s consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. All rights, protections, indemnifications and releases from liability granted hereunder to the Trustee shall extend to it acting in any capacity hereunder and its officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns.
To secure the Company’s payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Notes on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee other than money or property held in trust to pay principal of and interest on particular Notes.
The Company’s indemnification and payment obligations pursuant to this Section shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and the discharge of this Indenture. When the Trustee incurs expenses after the occurrence of a Default specified in Section 6.01(e) or (f) with respect to the Company, the expenses are intended to constitute expenses of administration under the Bankruptcy Law.
The provisions of this Section shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and the termination of this Indenture.</div>

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and may appoint a successor Trustee by so notifying the resigning Trustee of its replacement. The Company shall remove the Trustee if:
(a)            the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10;
(b)            the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent;
(c)            a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
(d)            the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting.
If the Trustee resigns, is removed by the Company or by the Holders a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and such Holders do not reasonably promptly (but in any event, within 30 days following such resignation or removal) appoint a successor Trustee, or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason (the Trustee in such event being referred to herein as the retiring Trustee), the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee.
A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07.
If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee or the Holders of 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Note for at least six months may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
Notwithstanding the replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section, the Company’s obligations under Section 7.07 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.</div>

However, without the consent of each Holder affected thereby, a modification or amendment may not:
(a)           change the Maturity Date of the principal of, or the time for, payment of any installment of interest on, any Notes, or reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon or any premium payable upon the redemption thereof or otherwise as provided in this Indenture, or change the coin or currency in which the principal of any Notes or any premium or the interest thereon is payable;
(b)           [reserved];
(c)           amend the contractual right expressly set forth in this Indenture (including Section 6.07) or any Note of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on such Note on or after the Stated Maturity or redemption date of any such Notes;
(d)           reduce the percentage in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, the consent of whose Holders is required for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver (of compliance with certain provisions of this Indenture or certain defaults hereunder and their consequences) provided for in this Indenture; and
(e)            modify any of the provisions of this Section 9.02 or Sections 6.04 and 6.05, except to increase the percentage of outstanding Notes the consent of whose Holders is required for such actions or to provide that certain other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Note affected thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of the Holders of at least 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, no amendment or waiver may (A) make any change in any Security Document or the provisions in this Indenture dealing with Collateral or application of trust proceeds of the Collateral with the effect of releasing the Liens on all or substantially all of the Collateral which secure the Secured Notes Obligations or (B) change or alter the priority of the Liens securing the Secured Notes Obligations in any material portion of the Collateral in any way materially adverse, taken as a whole, to the Holders, other than, in each case, as provided under the terms of this Indenture or the Security Documents.
Upon the request of the Company and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 9.06, the Trustee and/or the Notes Collateral Agent shall join with the Company in the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture or security documents or intercreditor agreements (provided, that any such intercreditor agreement may reflect that any additional Indebtedness referenced therein has Liens either senior to or junior to the Secured Notes Obligations or any Consolidated First Lien Debt, as applicable, so long as such Liens are permitted under the Indenture, or any joinder with respect to any of the foregoing) upon the receipt of an Officer’s Certificate stating that such execution and delivery is permitted by the Indenture and all conditions precedent relating to such execution and delivery have been satisfied, unless such amended or supplemental indenture or security documents or intercreditor agreements directly affect the Trustee’s own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental indenture.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
In addition, Holders will be deemed to have consented for purposes of the Security Documents and the applicable Intercreditor Agreements, and the Notes Collateral Agent and the Trustee will be authorized, to amend or supplement the Security Documents or enter into a new intercreditor agreement to add additional secured parties to the extent Liens securing Indebtedness and other Obligations held by such parties are permitted under this Indenture. In executing any such amendment, supplement, joinder, consent or waiver to applicable Intercreditor Agreements or other Security Document or in entering into a new intercreditor agreement or Security Document, the Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to receive and (subject to their duties set forth in this Indenture) shall be fully protected in relying upon an Officer’s Certificate stating that the execution of such amendment, supplement, joinder, consent or waiver or new agreement is authorized or permitted by such Intercreditor Agreement and/or other Security Document, as the case may be, and complies with the provisions thereof and of this Indenture. Notwithstanding anything in this Indenture to the contrary, no opinion of counsel shall be required in connection with the execution by the Trustee or Notes Collateral Agent of any such amendment, supplement, joinder, consent waiver or other modification to any Intercreditor Agreement and/or the other Security Documents or the entering into of a new intercreditor agreement or Security Document.
After an amendment under this Section becomes effective, the Company shall mail to Holders a notice briefly describing such amendment. The failure to give such notice to all Holders, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment under this Section.</div>

            <div class="raw-section">Subject to the provisions of this Article XI, each Guarantor hereby fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, jointly and severally with each other Guarantor, to each Holder of the Notes and the Trustee, the full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, of the principal of, premium, if any (including the Applicable Premium), and interest on the Notes and all other obligations and liabilities of the Company under this Indenture and the Notes (including, without limitation, any interest, fees or expenses accruing subsequent to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, whether or not such interest, fees or expenses is an allowed claim under applicable state, federal or foreign law and the obligations under Section 7.07) (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the “Guarantor Obligations”). Each Guarantor agrees that the Guarantor Obligations will rank equally in right of payment with other indebtedness of such Guarantor, except to the extent such other Indebtedness is subordinate to the Guarantor Obligations. Each Guarantor further agrees (to the extent permitted by law) that the Guarantor Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound under this Article XI notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guarantor Obligation.
Each Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of payment from and protest to the Company of any of the Guarantor Obligations and also waives notice of protest for non-payment. Each Guarantor waives notice of any default under the Notes or the Guarantor Obligations.
Each Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (and not a guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder to any security held for payment of the Guarantor Obligations.
Except as set forth in Section 11.02, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than payment of the Guarantor Obligations in full), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guarantor Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by (a) the failure of any Holder to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Company or any other person under, this Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal granted; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement; (d) the release of any security held by any Holder or the Trustee for the Guarantor Obligations or any of them; (e) the failure of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy against any other Guarantor; (f) any change in the ownership of the Company; (g) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guarantor Obligations; or (h) any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of such Guarantor as a matter of law or equity.
Each Guarantor agrees that its Guarantee herein shall remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the Guarantor Obligations or such Guarantor is released from its Guarantee in compliance with Section 11.03 hereof. Each Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any of the Guarantor Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise.
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay any of the Guarantor Obligations when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Holders an amount equal to the sum of (i) the unpaid amount of such Guarantor Obligations then due and owing and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest on such Guarantor Obligations then due and owing (but only to the extent not prohibited by law).
Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between such Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the Guarantor Obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in this Indenture for the purposes of its Guarantee herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Guarantor Obligations guaranteed hereby and (y) in the event of any such declaration of acceleration of such Guarantor Obligations, such Guarantor Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantor for the purposes of this Guarantee.
Each Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee or the Holders in enforcing any rights under this Section.</div>

The Notes Collateral Agent agrees to act as such on the express conditions contained in this Section 12.08. Each Holder agrees that any action taken by the Notes Collateral Agent in accordance with the provision of this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents, and the exercise by the Notes Collateral Agent of any rights or remedies set forth herein and therein shall be authorized and binding upon all Holders. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements, the duties of the Notes Collateral Agent shall be ministerial and administrative in nature, and the Notes Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, including any duty to monitor, perfect, maintain or enforce any security interest, except those expressly set forth herein and in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements to which the Notes Collateral Agent is a party, nor shall the Notes Collateral Agent have or be deemed to have any trust or other fiduciary relationship with the Trustee, any Holder or any Grantor, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements or otherwise exist against the Notes Collateral Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term “agent” in this Indenture with reference to the Notes Collateral Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.
(b)           The Notes Collateral Agent may perform any of its duties under this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements by or through receivers, agents, employees, attorneys-in-fact or with respect to any specified Person, such Person’s Affiliates, and the respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and attorneys-in-fact of such Person and its Affiliates (a “Related Person”), and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties, and shall be entitled to act upon, and shall be fully protected in taking action in reliance upon any advice or opinion given by legal counsel. The Notes Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any receiver, agent, employee, attorney-in-fact or Related Person that it selects as long as such selection was made in good faith and with due care.
(c)           None of the Notes Collateral Agent or any of its respective Related Persons shall (i) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Indenture or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or under or in connection with any Security Document or the Intercreditor Agreements or the transactions contemplated thereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of the Trustee or any Holder for any recital, statement, representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company or any other Grantor or Affiliate of any Grantor, or any Officer or Related Person thereof, contained in this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Notes Collateral Agent under or in connection with, this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements, or for any failure of any Grantor or any other party to this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. None of the Notes Collateral Agent or any of its respective Related Persons shall be under any obligation to the Trustee or any Holder to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements or to inspect the properties, books, or records of any Grantor or any Grantor’s Affiliates.
(d)           The Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, certification, telephone message, statement, or other communication, document or conversation (including those by telephone or e-mail) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent, or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to the Company or any other Grantor), independent accountants and other experts and advisors selected by the Notes Collateral Agent. The Notes Collateral Agent shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, or other paper or document. The Notes Collateral Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Trustee or the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes as it determines and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Holders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Notes Collateral Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements in accordance with a request, direction, instruction or consent of the Trustee or the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Holders.
(e)           The Notes Collateral Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, unless a Responsible Officer of the Notes Collateral Agent shall have received written notice from the Trustee or the Company referring to this Indenture, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default.” The Notes Collateral Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be requested by the Trustee in accordance with Article VI or the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes (subject to this Section 12.08).
(f)            The Notes Collateral Agent may resign at any time by notice to the Trustee and the Company, such resignation to be effective upon the acceptance of a successor agent to its appointment as Notes Collateral Agent. If the Notes Collateral Agent resigns under this Indenture, the Company shall appoint a successor collateral agent. If no successor collateral agent is appointed prior to the intended effective date of the resignation of the Notes Collateral Agent (as stated in the notice of resignation), the Trustee, at the direction of the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, may appoint a successor collateral agent, subject to the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and which shall not be required during a continuing Event of Default). If no successor collateral agent is appointed and consented to by the Company pursuant to the preceding sentence within thirty (30) days after the intended effective date of resignation (as stated in the notice of resignation) the Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor collateral agent hereunder, such successor collateral agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Notes Collateral Agent, and the term “Notes Collateral Agent” shall mean such successor collateral agent, and the retiring Notes Collateral Agent’s appointment, powers and duties as the Notes Collateral Agent shall be terminated. After the retiring Notes Collateral Agent’s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Section 12.08 shall continue to inure to its benefit and the retiring Notes Collateral Agent shall not by reason of such resignation be deemed to be released from liability as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Notes Collateral Agent under this Indenture.
(g)           The Trustee shall initially act as Notes Collateral Agent and shall be authorized to appoint co-Notes Collateral Agents as necessary in its sole discretion. Except as otherwise explicitly provided herein or in the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements, neither the Notes Collateral Agent nor any of its respective officers, directors, employees or agents or other Related Persons shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part thereof. The Notes Collateral Agent shall be accountable only for amounts that it actually receives as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither the Notes Collateral Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
(h)           The Notes Collateral Agent is authorized and directed to (i) enter into the Security Documents to which it is party, whether executed on or after the Issue Date, (ii) enter into the Intercreditor Agreements, including joinders and supplements thereto, whether executed on or after the Issue Date, (iii) make the representations of the Holders set forth in the Security Documents and Intercreditor Agreements, (iv) bind the Holders on the terms as set forth in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements and (v) perform and observe its obligations under the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements.
(i)            If at any time or times the Trustee shall receive (i) by payment, foreclosure, set-off or otherwise, any proceeds of Collateral or any payments with respect to the Obligations arising under, or relating to, this Indenture, except for any such proceeds or payments received by the Trustee from the Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, or (ii) payments from the Notes Collateral Agent in excess of the amount required to be paid to the Trustee pursuant to Article VI, the Trustee shall promptly turn the same over to the Notes Collateral Agent, in kind, and with such endorsements as may be required to negotiate the same to the Notes Collateral Agent such proceeds to be applied by the Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements.
(j)            The Notes Collateral Agent is each Holder’s agent for the purpose of perfecting the Holders’ security interest in assets which, in accordance with Article IX of the Uniform Commercial Code can be perfected only by possession. Should the Trustee obtain possession of any such Collateral, upon request from the Company, the Trustee shall notify the Notes Collateral Agent thereof and promptly shall deliver such Collateral to the Notes Collateral Agent or otherwise deal with such Collateral in accordance with the Notes Collateral Agent’s instructions.
(k)           The Notes Collateral Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to the Trustee or any of the Holders to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by any Grantor or is cared for, protected, or insured or has been encumbered, or that the Notes Collateral Agent’s Liens have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected, maintained or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to determine whether all of the Grantor’s property constituting Collateral intended to be subject to the Lien and security interest of the Security Documents has been properly and completely listed or delivered, as the case may be, or the genuineness, validity, marketability or sufficiency thereof or title thereto, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities, and powers granted or available to the Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to this Indenture, any Security Document or the Intercreditor Agreements other than pursuant to the instructions of the Trustee or the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes or as otherwise provided in the Security Documents.
(l)            If the Company or any Guarantor (i) incurs any obligations in respect of Junior Priority Obligations at any time when no Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement is in effect and (ii) delivers to the Notes Collateral Agent an Officer’s Certificate so stating and requesting the Notes Collateral Agent to enter into any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement in favor of a designated agent or representative for the holders of the junior priority obligations so incurred, the Notes Collateral Agent shall (and is hereby authorized an

The Company or the Trustee by notice to the other may designate additional or different addresses for subsequent notices or communications. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice.

All notices, approvals, consents, requests and any communications under this Indenture must be in writing (provided that any communication sent to the Trustee must be in the form of a document that is signed manually or by way of a digital signature provided by DocuSign (or such other digital signature provider as specified in writing to the Trustee by the Company)), in English.

(B)           if such Definitive Notes are being transferred to the Company, a certification to that effect; or
