then the Trustee shall cancel such Definitive Note and cause, or direct the Securities Custodian to cause, in accordance with the standing instructions and procedures existing between the Depository and the Securities Custodian, the aggregate principal amount of Notes represented by the Global Note to be increased by the aggregate principal amount of the Definitive Note to be exchanged and shall credit or cause to be credited to the account of the Person specified in such instructions a beneficial interest in the Global Note equal to the principal amount of the Definitive Note so canceled. If no Global Notes are then outstanding and the Global Note has not been previously exchanged for certificated securities pursuant to Section 2.4, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate, upon written order of the Company in the form of an Officers’ Certificate, a new Global Note in the appropriate principal amount.

Transfers by an owner of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note to a transferee who takes delivery of such interest through the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, shall be made only upon receipt by the Trustee of a certification in the form provided on the reverse of the Notes from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or (if available) Rule 144 under the Securities Act or pursuant to or in compliance with an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act other than Rule 144, Rule 903 or Rule 904 and that, if such transfer is being made prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, the interest transferred shall be held immediately thereafter through Euroclear or Clearstream.

(iii)          Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Exhibit A (other than the provisions set forth in Section 2.4), a Global Note may not be transferred as a whole except by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository or by the Depository or any such nominee to a successor depository or a nominee of such successor depository.



(iv)          In the event that a Global Note is exchanged for Notes in definitive registered form pursuant to Section 2.4, such Notes may be exchanged only in accordance with such procedures as are substantially consistent with the provisions of this Section 2.3 (including the certification requirements set forth on the reverse, of the Notes intended to ensure that such transfers comply with Rule 144A, Regulation S or such other applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act, as the case may be) and such other procedures as may from time to time be adopted by the Company.



(d)            Restrictions on Transfer of Regulation S Global Note.



(i)            Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, interests in the Regulation S Global Note may only be held through Euroclear or Clearstream. During the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial ownership interests in the Regulation S Global Note may only be sold, pledged or transferred through Euroclear or Clearstream in accordance with the Applicable Procedures and only (1) so long as such security is eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person whom the selling holder reasonably believes is a QIB that purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the resale, pledge or transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (2) in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S, (3) pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act provided by Rule 144 (if applicable) under the Securities Act, or (4) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, in each case in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States. Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, transfers by an owner of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note to a transferee who takes delivery of such interest through the Rule 144A Global Note shall be made only in accordance with Applicable Procedures and upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification from the transferor of the beneficial interest in the form provided on the reverse of the Notes (as set forth in Appendix I hereto) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A.

The Company issued the Notes under an Indenture dated as of July 22, 2024 (the “Indenture”), among the Company, the Guarantors party thereto from time to time, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by express reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. 77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the “TIA”). Terms defined in the Indenture and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the TIA for a statement of those terms.



The Notes are senior secured obligations of the Company and can be issued in an initial amount of up to $[357,500,000] and additional amounts as part of the same series under the Indenture up to $50,000,000. The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the ability of AMC and its subsidiaries (including Holdings and its Subsidiaries (including the Company)) to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make distributions in respect of their capital stock, purchase or redeem capital stock, enter into transactions with stockholders or certain affiliates, create liens or consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. These limitations are subject to significant exceptions set forth in the Indenture.



The Guarantors (including each subsidiary of AMC that is required to guarantee the Guarantor Obligations pursuant to Section 4.10 of the Indenture) shall jointly and severally guarantee the Guarantor Obligations pursuant to the terms of the Indenture.



4.          Special Mandatory Redemption



Without limiting the obligations of the Company set forth in Sections 3.09 and 4.16 of the Indenture, the Company shall not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes except as provided below.



If, as of the date that is 90 days prior to the Maturity Date (as defined in the Existing First Lien Notes Indenture) of the Existing First Lien Notes, the aggregate principal amount of outstanding (i) Existing First Lien Notes and (ii) any Indebtedness in respect of any modification, refunding, replacement, substitution, restructuring or other refinancing thereof (together with, for the avoidance of doubt, all interest paid in kind on any such Indebtedness) with a Stated Maturity prior to the Maturity Date, collectively exceeds $190,000,000 (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Trigger Date”), the Company shall be required to redeem all of the Notes then outstanding by a date no later than ten (10) Business Days after the Special Mandatory Redemption Trigger Date (the “Special Mandatory Redemption End Date”) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”).



A-17





In the event that the Company becomes obligated to redeem the Notes pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph, the Company will promptly, and in any event not more than five (5) Business Days after the Special Mandatory Redemption Trigger Date, deliver notice to the Trustee of the special mandatory redemption and the date upon which the Notes will be redeemed (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date,” which date will be no later than the Special Mandatory Redemption End Date). The Trustee will then promptly deliver such notice electronically or by first-class mail to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the note register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of the Depository. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, on and after such Special Mandatory Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes and the Indenture will be discharged and cease to be of further effect.



5.          Soft Call



If a Soft Call Trigger Event occurs, the Company shall have the right, at its election, at any time, and from time to time, until the Close of Business on the second (2nd) Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, to redeem all (but not less than all) of the outstanding Notes for cash in the manner, and subject to the terms, set forth in Article III of the Indenture.



6.          Sinking Fund



The Notes are not subject to any sinking fund.



7.          Right of Holders to Require the Company to Repurchase Notes upon a Fundamental Change



As provided in, and subject to the terms of, Section 3.09 of the Indenture, if a Fundamental Change occurs, then each Holder will have the right to require the Company to repurchase such Holder’s Notes (or any portion thereof in amounts of $1.00 or whole multiples of $1.00 in excess thereof) for cash in amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of Notes subject to repurchase plus accrued and unpaid interest (which shall be deemed to accrue at the PIK Rate), if any, on such Notes to, but excluding, the applicable Fundamental Change Repurchase Date.



8.          Exchange Consideration; Exchange Adjustment Consideration



The Holder of this Note may exchange this Note into Exchange Consideration in the manner, and subject to the terms, set forth in Article X of the Indenture.

9.          Denominations; Transfer; Exchange



The Notes are in registered form in minimum denominations of $1.00 and integral multiples of $1.00 in excess thereof. A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. Upon any transfer or exchange, the Registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange of any Note that has been surrendered for exchange into shares of Common Stock (except to the extent that any portion of such Note is not subject to exchange), that is subject to a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice validly delivered and not withdrawn, that is subject to a Soft Call following the Close of Business on the second (2nd) Business Day following a Soft Call Notice Date in accordance with Article III of the Indenture, or for a period beginning 10 days before an offer to repurchase Notes or 10 days before an interest payment date.

The registered Holder of this Note may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.



11.          Unclaimed Money



If money for the payment of principal, premium or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Company at its written request unless an abandoned property law designates another Person. After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the Company and not to the Trustee for payment.



12.          Amendment, Supplement and Waiver



The Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees may be amended or supplemented as provided in Article IX of the Indenture.



13.          Defaults and Remedies



If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, subject to certain limitations, may declare all the Notes to be immediately due and payable. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default and shall result in the Notes being immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of such Events of Default without any further act of the Trustee or any Holder.



Holders of Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. Subject to certain limitations, Required Holders may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power under the Indenture. The Required Holders, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind any declaration of acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree, and if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except non-payment of principal or interest that has become due solely because of the acceleration.



14.          Security



The Notes shall be secured by the Collateral on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Indenture and the Security Documents. The Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as the case may be, hold the Collateral in trust for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, in each case pursuant to the Security Documents. Each Holder, by accepting this Note, consents and agrees to the terms of the Security Documents (including the provisions providing for the release of Collateral) as the same may be in effect or may be amended from time to time in accordance with their terms and the Indenture and authorizes and directs the Notes Collateral Agent to enter into the Security Documents on the Issue Date, and at any time after Issue Date, as applicable, and to perform its obligations and exercise its rights thereunder in accordance therewith.



A-19





15.          Trustee Dealings with the Company



Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA and incorporated by reference into the Indenture, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.



16.          No Recourse Against Others



A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of Holdings, the Company or any Guarantor shall not have any liability for any obligations of Holdings, the Company or any Guarantor under the Notes or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Note, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Notes.
