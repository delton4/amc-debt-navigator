(b)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any test or utilization of any basket contained in this Agreement, Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Total Assets, the Total Leverage Ratio or the First Lien Leverage Ratio shall be calculated on a Pro Forma Basis to give effect to all Specified Transactions (including the Transactions) that have been made during the applicable period of measurement or subsequent to such period and prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation is made and to the extent the proceeds of any new Indebtedness are to be used to repay other Indebtedness (including by repurchase, redemption, retirement, extinguishment, defeasance, discharge or pursuant to escrow or similar arrangements) no later than 60 days following the incurrence of such new Indebtedness, the Borrowers shall be permitted to give Pro Forma Effect to such repayment of Indebtedness.
(c)            [Reserved].
(d)            In the event that the Borrowers elect to prepare their financial statements in accordance with IFRS and such election results in a change in the method of calculation of financial covenants, standards or terms (collectively, the “Accounting Changes”) in this Agreement, the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent agree to enter into good faith negotiations in order to amend such provisions of this Agreement (including the levels applicable herein to any computation of the Total Leverage Ratio or the First Lien Leverage Ratio) so as to reflect equitably the Accounting Changes with the desired result that the criteria for evaluating the Borrowers’ financial condition shall be substantially the same after such change as if such change had not been made. Until such time as such an amendment shall have been executed and delivered by the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders, all financial covenants, standards and terms in this Agreement shall continue to be calculated or construed in accordance with GAAP (as determined in good faith by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower) (it being agreed that the reconciliation between GAAP and IFRS used in such determination shall be made available to Lenders) as if such change had not occurred.
(e)            For purposes of determining the permissibility of any action, change, transaction or event that requires a calculation of any financial ratio or test (including, without limitation, any First Lien Leverage Ratio test and/or any Total Leverage Ratio test, the amount of Consolidated EBITDA and/or Consolidated Total Assets), such financial ratio or test shall be calculated at the time such action is taken (subject to Section 1.07), such change is made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the case may be, and no Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of a change in such financial ratio or test occurring after the time such action is taken, such change is made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the case may be.</div>

For purposes of any determination of Consolidated Total Debt, amounts in currencies other than dollars shall be translated into dollars at the currency exchange rates used in preparing the most recently delivered financial statements pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b). Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time specify with the Borrowers’ consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) to appropriately reflect a change in currency of any country and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to such change in currency.
(b)            The Administrative Agent does not warrant, nor accept responsibility, nor shall the Administrative Agent have any liability with respect to the administration, submission or any other matter related to the rates in the definition of “Adjusted Term SOFR” or with respect to any comparable or successor rate thereto, except as expressly provided herein.</div>

            <div class="raw-section">In connection with any action being taken solely in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction, for purposes of:
(i)          determining compliance with any provision of this Agreement which requires the calculation of any financial ratio;
(ii)        determining the accuracy of representations and warranties and/or whether a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or any subset of Defaults or Events of Default) (other than for purposes of satisfying the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (a) and (b)); or
(iii)       testing availability under baskets set forth in this Agreement (including baskets measured as a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Total Assets);
in each case, at the option of the Borrowers (the Borrowers’ election to exercise such option in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction, an “LCT Election”), with such option to be exercised on or prior to the date of execution of the definitive agreements related to such Limited Condition Transaction, the date of determination of whether any such action is permitted hereunder, shall be deemed to be the date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Transaction are entered into (the “LCT Test Date”), and if, after giving Pro Forma Effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they had occurred at the beginning of the most recent Test Period ending prior to the LCT Test Date, the Borrowers could have taken such action on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio or basket, such ratio or basket shall be deemed to have been complied with.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Borrowers have made an LCT Election and any of the ratios or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio or basket, including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the Borrowers or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or action, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations; however, if any ratios improve or baskets increase as a result of such fluctuations, such improved ratios or baskets may be utilized. If the Borrowers have made an LCT Election for any Limited Condition Transaction, then in connection with any subsequent calculation of the incurrence ratios subject to the LCT Election on or following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of (i) the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or (ii) the date that the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated or expires without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio or basket shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming such Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated.</div>

(b)            Subject to Section 2.14, Term Loan Borrowing denominated in dollars shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or SOFR Loans as any Borrowers may request in accordance herewith. Each Lender at its option may make any Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(c)            At the commencement of each Interest Period for any SOFR Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum; provided that a SOFR Borrowing that results from a continuation of an outstanding SOFR Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to such outstanding Borrowing. At the time that each ABR Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum. Borrowings of more than one Type and Class may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of twenty Interest Periods in the aggregate for all Loans.
(d)            Subject to terms and conditions hereof and set forth in the applicable Open Market Purchase Agreement or the Note Exchange Agreement, as applicable, the Borrowers agree to issue (i) the Initial Exchange Term Loans hereunder to the Lenders as consideration for (x) the sale and assignment of its Existing Term Loans through an open market purchase by AMC and (y) the sale of its 2026 Second Lien Notes, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the Open Market Purchase Agreements and the Note Exchange Agreement, as applicable.
(e)            On the date of each issuance of Subsequent Exchange Term Loans, each Subsequent Exchange Term Lender shall receive the Subsequent Exchange Term Loans as set forth in the applicable Subsequent Exchange Term Loan Documents.
(f)            Upon the effectiveness of this Agreement, interest shall begin to accrue on the full amount thereof as of such date. Once repaid, the Term Loans may not be reborrowed.</div>

            <div class="raw-section">To request a Term Loan Borrowing, any Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request, which notice may be given by (A) telephone or (B) a Borrowing Request; provided that any telephone notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Borrowing Request. Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent (a) in the case of a SOFR Borrowing, not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, three U.S. Government Securities Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable (provided that notices in respect of Term Loan Borrowings (x) to be made on the Effective Date may be conditioned on the closing of the Exchange Transactions and (y) to be made in connection with any Subsequent Exchange Term Loans may be conditioned on the closing of the related open market purchases described in the Subsequent Exchange Term Loan Exchange Documents) and shall be delivered by hand delivery, facsimile or other electronic transmission (or, if requested by telephone, promptly confirmed in writing by hand delivery, facsimile or other electronic transmission) to the Administrative Agent and shall be signed by a Borrower. Each such Borrowing Request shall specify the following information:
(i)          the Class of such Borrowing;
(ii)         the aggregate amount of such Borrowing;
(iii)        the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;
(iv)        whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a SOFR Borrowing;
(v)         in the case of a SOFR Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”;
(vi)        the location and number of the Borrowers’ account to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.06; and
(vii)       except on the Effective Date, that, as of the date of such Borrowing, the conditions set forth in Section 4.02(a) and Section 4.02(b) are satisfied.
If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified as to any Borrowing, then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested SOFR Borrowing, then the Borrowers shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the applicable Class of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender’s Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.</div>

The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrowers by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrowers designated by the Borrowers in the applicable Borrowing Request.
(b)            Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance on such assumption and in its sole discretion, make available to the Borrowers a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such share on demand of the Administrative Agent. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon demand of the Administrative Agent therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrowers, and the Borrowers agree to pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand. The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from such Lender or the Borrowers interest on such corresponding amount, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrowers to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent (acting at the Direction of the Required Lenders) in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, the rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent to be its cost of funding such amount, or (ii) in the case of the Borrowers, the interest rate applicable to such Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.13. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing.
(c)            Obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Term Loans are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan.</div>

The Borrowers may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.
(b)            To make an election pursuant to this Section, any Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone (or, at the option of the Borrowers, in writing) by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrowers were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such request may be given by (1) telephone or (2) an Interest Election Request.

(A)           The Borrowers shall have the right to make a voluntary prepayment of Term Loans in cash at a discount to par (such prepayment, the “Discounted Term Loan Prepayment”) pursuant to the Borrowers Offer of Specified Discount Prepayment, Borrowers Solicitation of Discount Range Prepayment Offers or Borrowers Solicitation of Discounted Prepayment Offers, in each case made in accordance with this Section 2.11(a)(ii); provided that (x) the Borrowers shall not make any Borrowing of Revolving Loans to fund any Discounted Term Loan Prepayment and (y) the Borrowers shall not initiate any action under this Section 2.11(a)(ii) in order to make a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment with respect to any Class unless (I) at least ten (10) Business Days shall have passed since the consummation of the most recent Discounted Term Loan Prepayment with respect to such Class as a result of a prepayment made by the Borrowers on the applicable Discounted Prepayment Effective Date; or (II) at least three (3) Business Days shall have passed since the date the Borrowers were notified that no Term Lender was willing to accept any prepayment of any Term Loan and/or Other Term Loan at the Specified Discount, within the Discount Range or at any discount to par value, as applicable, or in the case of Borrowers Solicitation of Discounted Prepayment Offers, the date of the Borrowers’ election not to accept any Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers.

(I)            any such offer shall be made available, at the sole discretion of the Borrowers, to each Term Lender and/or each Lender with respect to any Class of Term Loans on an individual tranche basis,
(II)           any such offer shall specify the aggregate principal amount offered to be prepaid (the “Specified Discount Prepayment Amount”) with respect to each applicable tranche, the tranche or tranches of Term Loans subject to such offer and the specific percentage discount to par (the “Specified Discount”) of such Term Loans to be prepaid (it being understood that different Specified Discounts and/or Specified Discount Prepayment Amounts may be offered with respect to different tranches of Term Loans and, in such an event, each such offer will be treated as a separate offer pursuant to the terms of this Section),
(III)         the Specified Discount Prepayment Amount shall be in an aggregate amount not less than $1,000,000 and whole increments of $500,000 in excess thereof and
(IV)         each such offer shall remain outstanding through the Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date.
The Auction Agent will promptly provide each relevant Term Lender with a copy of such Specified Discount Prepayment Notice and a form of the Specified Discount Prepayment Response to be completed and returned by each such Term Lender to the Auction Agent (or its delegate) by no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day after the date of delivery of such notice to the relevant Term Lenders (the “Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date”).
(2)            Each relevant Term Lender receiving such offer shall notify the Auction Agent (or its delegate) by the Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date whether or not it agrees to accept a prepayment of any of its relevant then outstanding Term Loans at the Specified Discount and, if so (such accepting Term Lender, a “Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender”), the amount and the tranches of such Term Lender’s Term Loans to be prepaid at such offered discount. Each acceptance of a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment by a Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender shall be irrevocable. Any Term Lender whose Specified Discount Prepayment Response is not received by the Auction Agent by the Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date shall be deemed to have declined to accept the Borrowers Offer of Specified Discount Prepayment.
(3)            If there is at least one Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender, the Borrowers will make prepayment of outstanding Term Loans pursuant to this paragraph (B) to each Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender in accordance with the respective outstanding amount and tranches of Term Loans specified in such Term Lender’s Specified Discount Prepayment Response given pursuant to subsection (2); provided that, if the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans accepted for prepayment by all Discount Prepayment Accepting Lenders exceeds the Specified Discount Prepayment Amount, such prepayment shall be made pro-rata among the Discount Prepayment Accepting Lenders in accordance with the respective principal amounts accepted to be prepaid by each such Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender and the Auction Agent (in consultation with the Borrowers and subject to rounding requirements of the Auction Agent made in its reasonable discretion) will calculate such proration (the “Specified Discount Proration”). The Auction Agent shall promptly, and in any case within three (3) Business Days following the Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date, notify:
(I)            the Borrowers of the respective Term Lenders’ responses to such offer, the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date and the aggregate principal amount of the Discounted Term Loan Prepayment and the tranches to be prepaid,
(II)          each Term Lender of the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, and the aggregate principal amount and the tranches of Term Loans to be prepaid at the Specified Discount on such date and
(III)         each Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender of the Specified Discount Proration, if any, and confirmation of the principal amount, tranche and Type of Loans of such Term Lender to be prepaid at the Specified Discount on such date.
Each determination by the Auction Agent of the amounts stated in the foregoing notices to the Borrowers and Term Lenders shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error. The payment amount specified in such notice to the Borrowers shall be due and payable by the Borrowers on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date in accordance with subsection (F) below (subject to subsection (J) below).
(C)       (1)               Subject to the proviso to subsection (A) above, the Borrowers may from time to time solicit Discount Range Prepayment Offers by providing the Auction Agent with three (3) Business Days’ notice in the form of a Discount Range Prepayment Notice; provided that
(I)            any such solicitation shall be extended, at the sole discretion of the Borrowers, to each Term Lender and/or each Lender with respect to any Class of Loans on an individual tranche basis,
(II)          any such notice shall specify the maximum aggregate principal amount of the relevant Term Loans (the “Discount Range Prepayment Amount”), the tranche or tranches of Term Loans subject to such offer and the maximum and minimum percentage discounts to par (the “Discount Range”) of the principal amount of such Term Loans with respect to each relevant tranche of Term Loans willing to be prepaid by the Borrowers (it being understood that different Discount Ranges and/or Discount Range Prepayment Amounts may be offered with respect to different tranches of Term Loans and, in such an event, each such offer will be treated as a separate offer pursuant to the terms of this Section),
(III)          the Discount Range Prepayment Amount shall be in an aggregate amount not less than $1,000,000 and whole increments of $500,000 in excess thereof and
(IV)          each such solicitation by the Borrowers shall remain outstanding through the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date.
The Auction Agent will promptly provide each relevant Term Lender with a copy of such Discount Range Prepayment Notice and a form of the Discount Range Prepayment Offer to be submitted by a responding relevant Term Lender to the Auction Agent (or its delegate) by no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day after the date of delivery of such notice to the relevant Term Lenders (the “Discount Range Prepayment Response Date”). Each relevant Term Lender’s Discount Range Prepayment Offer shall be irrevocable and shall specify a discount to par within the Discount Range (the “Submitted Discount”) at which such Lender is willing to allow prepayment of any or all of its then outstanding Term Loans of the applicable tranche or tranches and the maximum aggregate principal amount and tranches of such Term Lender’s Term Loans (the “Submitted Amount”) such Term Lender is willing to have prepaid at the Submitted Discount. Any Term Lender whose Discount Range Prepayment Offer is not received by the Auction Agent by the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date shall be deemed to have declined to accept a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment of any of its Term Loans at any discount to their par value within the Discount Range.
(2)           The Auction Agent shall review all Discount Range Prepayment Offers received on or before the applicable Discount Range Prepayment Response Date and shall determine (in consultation with the Borrowers and subject to rounding requirements of the Auction Agent made in its sole reasonable discretion) the Applicable Discount and Term Loans to be prepaid at such Applicable Discount in accordance with this subsection (C). The Borrowers agree to accept on the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date all Discount Range Prepayment Offers received by Auction Agent by the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date, in the order from the Submitted Discount that is the largest discount to par to the Submitted Discount that is the smallest discount to par, up to and including the Submitted Discount that is the smallest discount to par within the Discount Range (such Submitted Discount that is the smallest discount to par within the Discount Range being referred to as the “Applicable Discount”) which yields a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment in an aggregate principal amount equal to the lower of (I) the Discount Range Prepayment Amount and (II) the sum of all Submitted Amounts. Each Term Lender that has submitted a Discount Range Prepayment Offer to accept prepayment at a discount to par that is larger than or equal to the Applicable Discount shall be deemed to have irrevocably consented to prepayment of Term Loans equal to its Submitted Amount (subject to any required proration pursuant to the following subsection (3)) at the Applicable Discount (each such Term Lender, a “Participating Lender”).
(3)           If there is at least one Participating Lender, the Borrowers will prepay the respective outstanding Term Loans of each Participating Lender in the aggregate principal amount and of the tranches specified in such Term Lender’s Discount Range Prepayment Offer at the Applicable Discount; provided that if the Submitted Amount by all Participating Lenders offered at a discount to par greater than the Applicable Discount exceeds the Discount Range Prepayment Amount, prepayment of the principal amount of the relevant Term Loans for those Participating Lenders whose Submitted Discount is a discount to par greater than or equal to the Applicable Discount (the “Identified Participating Lenders”) shall be made pro-rata among the Identified Participating Lenders in accordance with the Submitted Amount of each such Identified Participating Lender and the Auction Agent (in consultation with the Borrowers and subject to rounding requirements of the Auction Agent made in its sole reasonable discretion) will calculate such proration (the “Discount Range Proration”). The Auction Agent shall promptly, and in any case within five (5) Business Days following the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date, notify:
(I)            the Borrowers of the respective Term Lenders’ responses to such solicitation, the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, the Applicable Discount, and the aggregate principal amount of the Discounted Term Loan Prepayment and the tranches to be prepaid,
(II)           each Term Lender of the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, the Applicable Discount, and the aggregate principal amount and tranches of Term Loans to be prepaid at the Applicable Discount on such date,
(III)         each Participating Lender of the aggregate principal amount and tranches of such Term Lender to be prepaid at the Applicable Discount on such date, and
(IV)         if applicable, each Identified Participating Lender of the Discount Range Proration.
Each determination by the Auction Agent of the amounts stated in the foregoing notices to the Borrowers and Term Lenders shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error. The payment amount specified in such notice to the Borrowers shall be due and payable by the Borrowers on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date in accordance with subsection (F) below (subject to subsect

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (a) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (b) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. If the Benchmark Replacement is Daily Simple SOFR, all interest payments will be payable on a quarterly basis.
(ii)         Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.
(iii)        Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrowers and the Lenders of (A) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (B) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, (C) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 2.14(b)(iv) and (D) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.14(b), including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party hereto, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.14(b).
(iv)        Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (x) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent (acting at the Direction of the Required Lenders) in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (y) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (x) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.
(v)         Benchmark Unavailability Period. Upon the Borrowers’ receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period (until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrowers and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist), (i) the Borrowers may revoke any request for a borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of SOFR Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrowers will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans and (ii) any outstanding SOFR Loans will be deemed to have converted to ABR Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period. During a Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of the Alternate Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of the Alternate Base Rate.</div>

(ii)         impose on any Lender or the applicable market any other condition, cost or expense (other than with respect to Taxes) affecting this Agreement or SOFR Loans made by such Lender therein; or

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the actual cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any SOFR Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the actual cost to such Lender or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then, from time to time upon request of such Lender, the Borrowers will pay to such Lender, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased costs actually incurred or reduction actually suffered, provided that to the extent any such costs or reductions are incurred by any Lender as a result of any requests, rules, guidelines or directives enacted or promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Basel III after the Effective Date, then such Lender shall be compensated pursuant to this Section 2.15(a) only to the extent such Lender is imposing such charges on similarly situated borrowers under the other syndicated credit facilities that such Lender is a lender under. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this paragraph (a) will not apply to (A) Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes or (B) Excluded Taxes.
(b)            If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding liquidity or capital requirements has the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to liquidity or capital adequacy), then, from time to time upon request of such Lender, the Borrowers will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction actually suffered.
(c)            A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company in reasonable detail, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section delivered to the Borrowers shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 15 Business Days after receipt thereof.
(d)            Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrowers of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further, that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.</div>

(b)            Without limiting the provisions of paragraph (a) above, the Borrowers shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Requirements of Law.
(c)            The Borrowers shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 30 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and any Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.17) and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrowers by a Lender or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d)            Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.04(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (d).
(e)            As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.17, the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(f)             Each Lender shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law and such other documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent (i) as will permit such payments to be made without, or at a reduced rate of, withholding or (ii) as will enable the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to withholding or information reporting requirements. Each Lender shall, whenever a lapse or time or change in circumstances renders such documentation obsolete, expired or inaccurate in any material respect, deliver promptly to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent updated or other appropriate documentation (including any new documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent) or promptly notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal ineligibility to do so.
Without limiting the foregoing:
(1)           Each Lender that is a “United States person” within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent) two properly completed and duly signed original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding.
(2)            Each Lender that is not a “United States person” within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent) whichever of the following is applicable:
(A)            two properly completed and duly signed original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or any successor forms) claiming eligibility for the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party,
(B)            two properly completed and duly signed original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or any successor forms),
(C)            in the case of a Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 871(h) or Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) two properly completed and duly signed certificates substantially in the form of Exhibit P-1, P-2, P-3 and P-4, as applicable, (any such certificate, a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) two properly completed and duly signed original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or any successor forms),
(D)            to the extent a Lender is not the beneficial owner (for example, where the Lender is a partnership or a participating Lender), two properly completed and duly signed original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY (or any successor forms) of the Lender, accompanied by a Form W-8ECI, W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate, Form W-9, Form W-8IMY or any other required information (or any successor forms) from each beneficial owner that would be required under this Section 2.17(f) if such beneficial owner were a Lender, as applicable (provided that if the Lender is a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and not a participating Lender) and one or more direct or indirect partners are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, the U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate may be provided by such Lender on behalf of such direct or indirect partner(s)), or
(E)            two properly completed and duly signed original copies of any other form prescribed by applicable U.S. federal income tax laws as a basis for claiming a complete exemption from, or a reduction in, U.S. federal withholding tax on any payments to such Lender under the Loan Documents, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
(3)           If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine whether such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA and, if necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (3), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date hereof.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this clause (f), a Lender shall not be required to deliver any form or other documentation that such Lender is not legally eligible to deliver.
(g)            If the Borrowers determine in good faith that a reasonable basis exists for contesting any Taxes for which indemnification has been demanded hereunder, the Administrative Agent or the relevant Lender, as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrowers in a reasonable challenge of such Taxes if so requested by the Borrowers; provided that (a) the Administrative Agent or such Lender determines in its reasonable discretion that it would not be subject to any unreimbursed third party cost or expense or otherwise be prejudiced by cooperating in such challenge, (b) the Borrowers pay all related expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, and (c) the Borrowers indemnify the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, for any liabilities or other costs incurred by such party in connection with such challenge. The Administrative Agent or a Lender shall claim any refund that it determines is reasonably available to it, unless it concludes in its reasonable discretion that it would be adversely affected by making such a claim. If the Administrative Agent or a Lender receives a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrowers or with respect to which the Borrowers have paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrowers (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrowers under this Section with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrowers, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agree promptly to repay the amount paid over to the Borrowers (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. The Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, shall, at the Borrowers’ request, provide the Borrowers with a copy of any notice of assessment or other evidence of the requirement to repay such refund received from the relevant taxing authority (provided that the Administrative Agent or such Lender may delete any information therein that the Administrative Agent or such Lender deems confidential). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this Section 2.17(g) shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to Taxes which it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person.
(h)            Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to deliver to the Loan Parties and to any successor Administrative Agent any documentation provided by such Lender to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.17(f).
(i)             Each party’s obligations under this Section 2.17 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.</div>

Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent (acting at the Direction of the Required Lenders), be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to such account as may be specified by the Administrative Agent and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment (other than payments on the SOFR Loans) under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a SOFR Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate for the period of such extension. All payments or prepayments of any Loan shall be made in the currency in which such Loan is denominated, all payments of accrued interest payable on a Loan shall be made in dollars, and all other payments under each Loan Document shall be made in dollars.
(b)            If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all applicable amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied towards payment of applicable interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the applicable amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties.
(c)            If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans of a given Class resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans of such Class and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender with outstanding Loans of the same Class, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of such Class of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans of such Class; provided that
(i)            if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest and
(ii)           the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to
(A)           any payment made by the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement,
(B)           any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant or
(C)           any disproportionate payment obtained by a Lender of any Class as a result of the extension by Lenders of the maturity date or expiration date of some but not all Loans or Commitments of that Class or any increase in the Applicable Rate in respect of Loans of Lenders that have consented to any such extension.
The Borrowers consent to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrowers rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrowers in the amount of such participation.
(d)            Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrowers prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrowers will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption and in its sole discretion, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrowers have not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent (acting at the Direction of the Required Lenders) in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
(e)            If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.06(a), Section 2.06(b), Section 2.06(c), Section 2.18(d) or Section 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent (acting at the Direction of the Required Lenders) may, in its discretion and in the order determined by the Administrative Agent (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent (acting at the Direction of the Required Lenders) for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.</div>

(A)           the Borrowers shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent to the extent such consent would be required under Section 9.04(b) for an assignment of Loans or Commitments, as applicable, which consents, in each case, shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed,

            <div class="raw-section">(a)            After the Effective Date, any Borrower may, at any time, on one or more occasions pursuant to a Subsequent Exchange Term Loan Facility Amendment issue additional Exchange Term Loans that are pari passu with the Initial Exchange Term Loans (“Subsequent Exchange Term Loans”) (which loans shall thereafter for all purposes hereunder constitute Initial Exchange Term Loans) either (x) as consideration for additional open market purchases by any one or more of the Borrowers of Existing Term Loans as the Borrowers may elect pursuant to a Subsequent Exchange Term Loan Exchange Agreement or (y) for cash proceeds which are used to concurrently repurchase and/or refinance Existing Term Loans; provided, that:
(i)            [reserved],
(ii)           no issuance of Subsequent Exchange Term Loans in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.20 shall require the approval of any existing Lender,
(iii)         Subsequent Exchange Term Loans shall be pari passu in right of payment with the other Initial Exchange Term Loans in accordance with the terms hereof,
(iv)         any Subsequent Exchange Term Loans may participate in any voluntary prepayment of Term Loans as set forth in Section 2.11(a)(i), to the extent provided in such Section and Section 2.18(c), provided, that if multiple Classes of Term Loans are outstanding, each voluntary prepayment pursuant to Section 2.11(a)(i), shall be made on a pro rata basis for each Class that remains outstanding,
(v)          on the date of the Borrowing of any Subsequent Exchange Term Loans that will be of the same Class as any then-existing Class of Term Loans, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Sections 2.08 or 2.13 above, such Subsequent Exchange Term Loans shall be added to (and constitute a part of, be of the same Type as and, at the election of the Borrowers, have the same Interest Period as) each Borrowing of outstanding Term Loans of such Class on a pro rata basis (based on the relative sizes of such Borrowings), so that each Term Lender providing such Subsequent Exchange Term Loans will participate proportionately in each then-outstanding Borrowing of Term Loans of such Class; it being acknowledged that the application of this clause (a)(vi) may result in new Subsequent Exchange Term Loans having Interest Periods (the duration of which may be less than one month) that begin during an Interest Period then applicable to outstanding SOFR Loans of the relevant Class and which end on the last day of such Interest Period,
(vi)         notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.20 or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Borrowers may issue Subsequent Exchange Term Loans to a Lender (or any Subsequent Exchange Term Loan Lender) for cash under this Section 2.20 (and such loans so issued shall constitute Subsequent Exchange Term Loans for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents), so long as (x) substantially concurrently with such issuance a Borrower uses any such proceeds received to purchase Existing Term Loans at a price no greater than par and (y) any such issuance of Exchange Term Loans complies with each of the other provisions of this Section 2.20,
(vii)        the maturity date of any Subsequent Exchange Term Loans shall not be earlier than the Maturity Date;
(viii)       the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Subsequent Exchange Term Loans shall not be shorter than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Initial Exchange Term Loans;
(ix)          if the All-in Yield on any such Subsequent Exchange Term Loans shall exceed the All-in Yield on the Initial Exchange Term Loans then the Applicable Margin (or the “floor” as provided in the following proviso) applicable to the Initial Exchange Term Loans shall be increased such that after giving effect to such increase, the All-in Yield on the Initial Term Loans shall equal the All-in Yield on such Subsequent Exchange Term Loans;
(x)          such Subsequent Exchange Term Loans shall satisfy clauses (c), (d) (e) of the definition of Required Additional Debt Terms;
(xi)         if the Subsequent Exchange Term Loans shall have any call-protection or other premium or fee payable upon the full or partial repayment, prepayment or repurchase or acceleration thereof (any such benefit, “Call Protection”) then such Call Protection shall be added to the terms of the Initial Term Loans to the extent in excess of the premiums set forth in Section 2.11(a), and
(xii)        no Subsequent Exchange Term Lender shall receive Subsequent Exchange Term Loans or cash consideration in an aggregate amount greater than the outstanding principal amount (including any fees and interest accrued thereon) of such holder’s Remaining Term Loans as of the time of such Subsequent Exchange (plus any applicable PIK fees).
(b)            Each Lender providing a portion of any Subsequent Exchange Term Loans shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Top Borrower all such documentation (including the relevant Subsequent Exchange Term Loan Facility Amendment) as may be reasonably required by the Administrative Agent (acting at the Direction of the Required Lenders) to evidence and effectuate such Subsequent Exchange Term Loans. On the effective date of (x) any open market purchase by the Top Borrower of Existing Loans in exchange for any applicable tranche of Subsequent Exchange Term Loans or (y) issuance of any Subsequent Exchange Term Loans for cash, upon consummation of the applicable exchange, each Person selling Existing Term Loans or lending such proceeds of Subsequent Exchange Term Loans shall become a Lender for all purposes in connection with this Agreement.
(c)            As conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the issuance of any Subsequent Exchange Term Loans as consideration for the purchase of Existing Loans, (i) upon its request, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to receive customary reaffirmation agreements, supplements and/or amendments as it shall reasonably require, (ii) the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to receive, from each such Lender of Subsequent Exchange Term Loans, an Administrative Questionnaire and such other documents as it (acting at the Direction of the Required Lenders) shall reasonably require from such Person and (iii) the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to receive a certificate of the Borrowers signed by a Responsible Officer thereof that as of the date of the issuance of, and giving effect to the issuance of, the applicable Subsequent Exchange Term Loans, no Event of Default exists.
(d)            The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into any Subsequent Exchange Term Loan Facility Amendment and/or any amendment to any other Loan Document as may be necessary in order to establish new Classes or sub-Classes in respect of Loans or commitments pursuant to this Section 2.20 and such technical amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent (acting at the Direction of the Required Lenders) and the Borrowers in connection with the establishment of such new Classes or sub-Classes, in each case on terms consistent with this Section 2.20. In addition, any Subsequent Exchange Term Loan Facility Amendment with respect to any Subsequent Exchange Term Loans, without the consent of any Lenders (other than those providing such Subsequent Exchange Term Loans) or the Administrative Agent, may include such amendments to this Agreement as may be necessary, appropriate or advisable as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers to make the applicable Subsequent Exchange Term Loans “fungible” with the relevant existing Class of Subsequent Exchange Term Loans (including by modifying the applicable amortization schedule).</div>

<p><strong>Negative Covenants</strong> are the most important restrictions in the Credit Agreement. They limit what the Borrowers CANNOT do. Key provisions include limitations on new debt (6.01), new liens (6.02), fundamental changes (6.03), investments (6.04), asset sales (6.05), restricted payments (6.08), affiliate transactions (6.09), and the <strong>unique Cash Hoarding provision (6.13)</strong>. As the 1L lender, these covenants give the Term Loan the tightest set of restrictions in AMC's capital structure.</p>

<p><strong>Indebtedness; Certain Equity Securities.</strong> Neither AMC nor Muvico may incur Indebtedness except within specified baskets. Key permitted categories include: (a) obligations under this Credit Agreement; (b) existing indebtedness on Schedule 6.01; (c) intercompany debt (with subordination requirements); (d) capital lease obligations; (e) refinancing of existing debt (with anti-layering protections); (f) a general basket of the greater of $175M and 7.5% of Total Assets; (g) specific tranches for the Muvico notes and Odeon notes. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The Term Loan's debt incurrence baskets are tighter than those in the indentures, reflecting its senior priority position. The specific carve-outs for Muvico and Odeon notes show how the capital structure was carefully negotiated to permit the existing multi-tranche debt stack.</p>

<p><strong>Liens.</strong> No Borrower may create liens except for permitted liens. Key exceptions include: (a) liens securing this Credit Agreement (1L priority); (b) existing liens on Schedule 6.02; (c) liens on property acquired with purchase money debt; (d) junior liens securing the Muvico notes (capped); (e) general lien baskets. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> As the 1L tranche, the Credit Agreement's lien covenant is the strictest. It controls what additional secured debt can be issued and at what priority level. The specific carve-outs for the 1.25L, 1.5L, and 2L tranches in the Muvico structure were negotiated into this covenant.</p>

<p><strong>Asset Sales.</strong> Borrowers may not sell, transfer, or dispose of assets except: (a) sales in the ordinary course of business; (b) dispositions of obsolete or worn-out equipment; (c) sales where Net Proceeds are reinvested within 365 days or used to prepay Term Loans; (d) asset swaps of comparable value; (e) dispositions up to the greater of $100M and 4% of Total Assets in any fiscal year. Mandatory prepayment: 100% of Net Proceeds from non-ordinary course asset sales above threshold must be applied to prepay the Term Loan. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The Term Loan's asset sale sweep is more aggressive than the indentures - 100% of excess proceeds must go to prepay term loans first. This gives the 1L lender first claim on any asset disposition proceeds.</p>

<p><strong>Cash Hoarding -- UNIQUE PROVISION.</strong> This is a covenant found <strong>only in the Credit Agreement</strong> and not in any of the indentures. It restricts AMC from maintaining Unrestricted Cash (cash not needed for near-term operations) above a specified threshold. If Unrestricted Cash exceeds the cap for a specified number of consecutive business days, the excess must be used to prepay Term Loans. <strong>Why this is critical:</strong> Cash Hoarding prevents AMC from stockpiling cash while the Term Loan remains outstanding. In a distressed situation, companies often try to hoard cash to build a "war chest" for bankruptcy negotiations or to maintain leverage over creditors. This provision forces AMC to use excess liquidity to deleverage, directly benefiting Term Loan holders. <strong>With $417M of cash on the balance sheet</strong>, this covenant is actively relevant and likely constraining AMC's ability to accumulate additional cash reserves. This gives the 1L lenders a powerful enforcement mechanism that the noteholders (DOC 2, 3, 5, 6, 7) simply do not have.</p>

<p><strong>Events of Default</strong> in the Credit Agreement trigger acceleration of the $2B Term Loan. Because this is the 1L tranche, acceleration here would cascade through the entire capital structure via cross-default provisions in DOC 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. The Term Loan's Events of Default are generally more sensitive (lower thresholds, shorter cure periods) than those in the indentures.</p>

<p><strong>Events of Default</strong> include: (a) failure to pay principal when due (no cure period); (b) failure to pay interest within 5 business days; (c) false representations/warranties (30-day cure); (d) covenant breaches (30-day cure for affirmative covenants; immediate for negative covenants and financial covenants); (e) cross-default on $50M+ Indebtedness; (f) bankruptcy/insolvency (immediate); (g) ERISA events exceeding $50M; (h) material judgment defaults; (i) Change of Control; (j) collateral impairment. <strong>Key differences from indentures:</strong> The Credit Agreement has (1) shorter cure periods (30 days vs. 60 days), (2) immediate default for negative covenant breaches (no cure), and (3) a Change of Control trigger (which some indentures lack). This makes the Term Loan the "hair trigger" in the capital structure.</p>

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Lender and the Administrative Agent hereby acknowledge and agree that a restatement of historical financial statements shall not result in a Default hereunder (whether pursuant to Section 7.01(c) as it relates to a representation made with respect to such financial statements (including any interim unaudited financial statements) or pursuant to Section 7.01(d) as it relates to delivery requirements for financial statements pursuant to Section 5.01) to the extent that such restatement does not reveal any material adverse difference in the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries in the previously reported information from actual results reflected in such restatement for any relevant prior period.
Without limited the generality of the foregoing in this Section 7.01, it is understood and agreed that if the Loan Document Obligations are accelerated as a result of an Event of Default (including, but not limited to any event with respect to the any Borrower described in paragraph (h) or (i) of this Article or upon the occurrence or commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding or other event pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable law for the relief of debtors (including the acceleration of claims by operation of law)), the Loan Document Obligations that become due and payable shall include the premium (if any) above par, including the Make-Whole Amount and the Prepayment Premium, that would have been due on such date if the Term Loans were optionally prepaid pursuant to Section 2.11(a) on such date or, if applicable, repaid on the Maturity Date (any such premium, the “Applicable Premium”), which shall become immediately due and payable by the Borrowers and the other Loan Parties and shall constitute part of the Loan Document Obligations as if the Term Loans were being optionally redeemed or repaid as of such date, in view of the impracticability and extreme difficulty of ascertaining actual damages and by mutual agreement of the parties as to a good faith reasonable estimate and calculation of each Lender’s lost profits and/or actual damages as a result thereof. The Applicable Premium (if any) shall also be automatically and immediately due and payable if the Loan Document Obligations are satisfied or released by foreclosure (whether by power of judicial proceeding or otherwise), deed in lieu of foreclosure, or by any other means in connection with an Event of Default described in the preceding sentence or are reinstated, including without limitation, under a plan of reorganization or similar manner in any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding. The Applicable Premium (if any) payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be presumed to be the liquidated damages sustained by each Lender as the result of the early repayment or prepayment of the Term Loans (and not unmatured interest or a penalty) and the Borrowers and other Loan Parties agree that it is reasonable under the circumstances currently existing. EACH OF THE BORROWERS AND THE OTHER LOAN PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVE (TO THE FULLEST EXTENT THEY MAY LAWFULLY DO SO) THE PROVISIONS OF ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE STATUTE OR LAW THAT PROHIBITS OR MAY PROHIBIT THE COLLECTION OF THE PREPAYMENT FEE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH ACCELERATION. Each of the Borrowers and the other Loan Parties expressly agree (to the fullest extent they may lawfully do so) that: (A) the Applicable Premium is reasonable and the product of an arm’s length transaction between sophisticated business people, ably represented by counsel; (B) the Applicable Premium shall each be payable notwithstanding the then prevailing market rates at the time payment or redemption is made; (C) there has been a course of conduct between Lenders, the Borrowers and the other Loan Parties giving specific consideration in this transaction for such agreement to pay the Applicable Premium; (D) any such Loan Party shall not challenge or question, or support any other Person in challenging or questioning, the validity or enforceability of the Applicable Premium or any similar or comparable prepayment fee, and such Loan Party shall be estopped from raising or relying on any judicial decision or ruling questioning the validity or enforceability of any prepayment fee similar or comparable to the Applicable Premium, and (E) the Borrower and the other Loan Parties shall be estopped hereafter from claiming differently than as agreed to in this paragraph. Each of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties expressly acknowledge that its agreement to pay or guarantee the payment of the Applicable Premium to the Lenders as herein described are individually and collectively a material inducement to Lenders to make available (or be deemed to make available) the Loans hereunder.</div>

The provisions of this Article (other than Resignation and Collateral and Guaranty Matters) are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders, and none of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary of any such provision. The use of the term “agent” herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.
(b)           The Collateral Agent shall also act as the “collateral agent” under the Loan Documents, and each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Collateral Agent to act as the agent of such Lender for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the Secured Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. In this connection, the Collateral Agent, as “collateral agent” and any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Collateral Agent pursuant to ‎Section 8.05 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Collateral Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent, shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article VIII and ‎Article IX (including the second paragraph of ‎Section 9.03), as though such co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the “collateral agent” under the Loan Documents as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Collateral Agent shall have all of the rights, privileges, immunities and indemnities of the Administrative Agent for such purposes, and all references in this Article VIII to the Administrative Agent shall include the Collateral Agent for such purpose. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Lenders hereby expressly authorize the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to (i) subject to ‎Section 8.10, execute any and all documents (including releases) with respect to the Collateral and the rights of the Secured Parties with respect thereto, as contemplated by and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Collateral Documents and acknowledge and agree that any such action by any Agent shall bind the Lenders and (ii) subject to Sections 8.09 and ‎9.02, negotiate, enforce or settle any claim, action or proceeding affecting the Lenders in their capacity as such, acting at the Direction of the Required Lenders, which negotiation, enforcement or settlement will be binding upon each Lender.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="raw-section">(a)           Each Lender hereby agrees that if the Administrative Agent notifies a Lender or Secured Party or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender or Secured Party (any such Lender, Secured Party or other recipient, a “Erroneous Payment Recipient”) in writing that the Administrative Agent has determined in its reasonable discretion that the Administrative Agent or its Affiliates mistakenly transmitted funds to such Erroneous Payment Recipient, as a result of a clerical, mechanical, technological or other error, whether or not known to such Erroneous Payment Recipient (any such funds, whether as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, individually and collectively, an “Erroneous Payment”) and demands in writing the return of such Erroneous Payment (or a portion thereof), such Erroneous Payment Recipient shall make commercially reasonable efforts to promptly return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a written demand was made, in same day funds (in the currency so received). A notice from the Administrative Agent to any Lender under this ‎Section 8.12(a) shall set forth the facts and circumstances resulting in such Erroneous Payment; provided that the Administrative Agent shall not make any demand under this ‎Section 8.12(a) unless the notice described herein is delivered within 90 days after the making of the applicable Erroneous Payment.
(b)           Without limiting the immediately preceding clause (a), each Lender or Secured Party hereby further agrees that if it (or an Erroneous Payment Recipient on its behalf) receives a payment from the Administrative Agent (x) in a different amount or on a different date than the amount or date specified in a notice of payment sent by the Administrative Agent with respect to such payment, (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a notice of payment sent by the Administrative Agent, or (z) that such Lender or Secured Party (or Erroneous Payment Recipient on its behalf) otherwise becomes aware was transmitted, or received, in error or by mistake (in whole or in part) then, in each case, such Lender or Secured Party shall presume that an error has been made (absent written confirmation from the Administrative Agent) and shall promptly (and, in all events, within one Business Day of its knowledge of such error) notify the Administrative Agent of its receipt of such payment, the details thereof (in reasonable detail) and that it is so notifying the Administrative Agent pursuant to this ‎Section 8.12(b).
(c)           Each Erroneous Payment Recipient hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off, net and apply any amounts at any time owing to such Erroneous Payment Recipient under any Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under the preceding clause (a).
(d)           The Borrowers and each other Loan Party hereby agrees that (i) in the event an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered from any Erroneous Payment Recipient (and without limiting the Administrative Agent’s rights and remedies under this Section 8.12), the Administrative Agent shall be subrogated to all the rights of such Erroneous Payment Recipient with respect to such amount (such rights, the “Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights”) and (ii) an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Borrowers or any other Loan Party. If the amount of any Erroneous Payment is subsequently recovered by the Administrative Agent or its Affiliates, the Administrative Agent or such Affiliate shall return to the applicable Erroneous Payment Recipient either (x) the Loans acquired pursuant to this clause (d) or (y) if applicable, the proceeds of such Loans. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, and for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the occurrence of an Erroneous Payment (or any Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights or other rights of the Administrative Agent in respect of an Erroneous Payment) result in the Administrative Agent becoming or being deemed to be a Lender hereunder or the holder of any Loans hereunder.
(e)           In addition to any rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent provided by law, the Administrative Agent shall have the right, without prior notice to any Lender, any such notice being expressly waived by such Lender to the extent permitted by applicable law, with respect to any Erroneous Payment for which a demand has been made in accordance with this Section 8.12 and which has not been returned to the Administrative Agent, to set off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final but excluding trust accounts), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by the Administrative Agent or any Affiliate, branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of such Lender. The Administrative Agent agrees to promptly notify the Lender after any such setoff and application made by the Administrative Agent; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.
(f)            Each party’s obligations under this Section 8.12 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent, the termination of the Commitments or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document.</div>

The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.

No notice or demand on the Borrowers in any case shall entitle the Borrowers to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
(b)           Except as expressly provided herein, neither any Loan Document nor any provision thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent (to the extent that such waiver, amendment or modification does not affect the rights, duties, privileges or obligations of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall execute such waiver, amendment or other modification to the extent approved by the Required Lenders) and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders, provided that no such agreement shall
(i)            increase the Commitment of any Lender (other than with respect to any Subsequent Exchange Term Loan Facility pursuant to Section 2.20 in respect of which such Lender has agreed to be a Subsequent Exchange Term Loan Lender) without the written consent of such Lender (it being understood that a waiver of any condition precedent set forth in Section 4.02 or the waiver of any Default, Event of Default, mandatory prepayment or mandatory reduction of the Commitments shall not constitute an extension or increase of any Commitment of any Lender),
(ii)           reduce the principal amount of any Loan (it being understood that a waiver of any Default, Event of Default, mandatory prepayment or mandatory reduction of the Commitments shall not constitute a reduction or forgiveness in principal) or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby (it being understood that any change to the definition of “Total Leverage Ratio” or in the component definitions thereof shall not constitute a reduction of interest or fees), provided that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary to waive any obligation of the Borrowers to pay default interest pursuant to Section 2.13(c),
(iii)           postpone the maturity of any Loan (it being understood that a waiver of any Default, Event of Default, mandatory prepayment or mandatory reduction of the Commitments shall not constitute an extension of any maturity date), or the date of any scheduled amortization payment of the principal amount of any Loan under Section 2.10, or any date for the payment of any interest or fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby),
(iv)          change any of the provisions of this Section without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, provided that any such change which is in favor of a Class of Lenders holding Loans maturing after the maturity of other Classes of Lenders (and only takes effect after the maturity of such other Classes of Loans or Commitments) will require the written consent of the Required Lenders with respect to each Class directly and adversely affected thereby,
(v)           lower the percentage set forth in the definition of “Required Lenders” or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders (or Lenders of any Class) required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender (or each Lender of such Class, as the case may be),
(vi)          (A) release all or substantially all the value of the Guarantees under the Guaranty (except as expressly provided in the Loan Documents) without the written consent of each Lender or (B) amend modify, terminate or waive the last paragraph of Section 9.15 without the written consent of each Lender,
(vii)         release all or substantially all the Collateral from the Liens of the Security Documents, without the written consent of each Lender (except as expressly provided in the Loan Documents),
(viii)        change the currency in which any Loan is denominated, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby,
(ix)           change (A) any of the provisions of Section 7.03, or Section 4.02 of the Pledge and Security Agreement and/or the similar “waterfall” provisions in the other Security Documents referred to therein or (B) Section 2.18(c), in each case without the written consent of each Lender,

(xi)           amend, modify or waive any provision of the Loan Documents in a manner that would permit any Subsidiary to be designated as an “Unrestricted Subsidiary” or permit the transfer of any assets (including by Disposition, Investment or Restricted Payments) to “Unrestricted Subsidiaries” or otherwise permit the creation or existence of, or transfer of any assets (including by Disposition, Investment or Restricted Payments) to, a Subsidiary otherwise not subject to the provisions of the Credit Documents (it being acknowledged that no Subsidiary is an “Unrestricted Subsidiary” hereunder as of the Effective Date) without the written consent of each Lender;
(xii)         amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 6.12 without the written consent of each Lender;
(xiii)        to the extent not otherwise permitted by this Agreement as of the Effective Date, authorize additional Indebtedness that would be issued under the Loan Documents for the purpose of influencing voting thresholds without the written consent of each Lender;
(xiv)        amend, modify or waive any provision of the Loan Documents to allow for purchases of any Loans (by open market purchase or through other assignments) by the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries or other Affiliates or make Discounted Term Loan Prepayments or other “Dutch Auction” prepayments or repurchases other than for cash consideration without the written consent of each Lender;
(xv)         amend, modify or waive any provision of any Loan Document in a manner that would be disproportionately adverse to any Lender vis-à-vis any other Lender without the written consent of each Lender;
(xvi)        permit the receipt by the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries of any non-cash consideration (or any consideration deemed to be cash consideration) except as permitted under this Agreement as of the Effective Date without the consent of each Lender;
(xvii)       amend, modify or waive the definitions of “Maturity Date” and “Springing Maturity Date Condition” without the written consent of each Lender;
(xviii)      amend, modify, terminate or waive the definition of “Ratings Trigger Period” and/or Section 2.13(b) without the written consent of each Lender;
provided, further, that
(A)          no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, including, without limitation, any amendment of this Section,
(B)           any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document may be amended by an agreement in writing entered into by the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, error, defect or inconsistency and
(C)           any waiver, amendment or modification of this Agreement that by its terms affects the rights or duties under this Agreement of Lenders holding Loans or Commitments of a particular Class (but not the Lenders holding Loans or Commitments of any other Class) may be effected by an agreement or agreements in writing entered into solely by the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the requisite percentage in interest of the affected Class of Lenders stating that would be required to consent thereto under this Section if such Class of Lenders were the only Class of Lenders hereunder at the time.

(b)           this Agreement and other Loan Documents may be amended or supplemented by an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers or any Loan Party as to which such agreement or agreements is to apply, without the need to obtain the consent of any Lender, to include “parallel debt” or similar provisions, and any authorizations or granting of powers by the Lenders and the other Secured Parties in favor of the Collateral Agent, in each case required to create in favor of the Collateral Agent any security interest contemplated to be created under this Agreement, or to perfect any such security interest, where the Administrative Agent shall have been advised by its counsel that such provisions are necessary or advisable under local law for such purpose (with the Borrowers hereby agreeing to, and to cause their subsidiaries to, enter into any such agreement or agreements upon reasonable request of the Administrative Agent promptly upon such request) and
(c)           upon notice thereof by the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent with respect to the inclusion of any previously absent financial maintenance covenant or other covenant, this Agreement shall be amended by an agreement in writing entered into by the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent without the need to obtain the consent of any Lender to include any such covenant on the date of the incurrence of the applicable Indebtedness to the extent required by the terms of such definition or section.

In addition, the Borrowers agree (a) to pay or reimburse the Agent for all reasonable and documented or invoiced out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including any and all recording and filing fees, costs and expenses incurred pursuant to any Loan Document, associated with the syndication of the Loans and the preparation, execution and delivery, administration, amendment, modification, waiver and/or enforcement of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and any amendment, waiver, consent or other modification of the provisions hereof and thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated thereby are consummated), including all Attorney Costs of one primary counsel (and a single local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction or otherwise retained with the Borrowers’ consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)), (b) to pay or reimburse the Agent for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement of any rights or remedies under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (including Attorney Costs of one firm or counsel to the Agent and, to the extent required, one firm or local counsel in each relevant local jurisdiction or otherwise retained with the Borrowers’ consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), which may include a single special counsel acting in multiple jurisdictions) and (c) to pay or reimburse the Lenders for all their reasonable and documented out of pocket costs and expenses (without duplication) incurred in connection with the development, preparation, execution and delivery of, and any amendment, supplement, modification to, waiver, enforcement and preservation of rights under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other documents in connection herewith or therewith, and the consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of one firm of counsel to the Lenders taken as a whole (it being understood such counsel shall initially be Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP), and, to the extent required one firm of local counsel in each relevant local jurisdiction (which may include a single special counsel acting in multiple jurisdictions)). Subject to the limitations above, the foregoing costs and expenses shall include all reasonable search, filing, recording and title insurance charges and fees related thereto, and other reasonable and documented or invoiced out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agent. The agreements in this Section 9.03 shall survive the termination of the Commitments and repayment of all other Loan Document Obligations. All amounts due under this Section 9.03 shall be paid within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the Borrowers of an invoice relating thereto setting forth such expenses in reasonable detail.

(i)            The Borrowers agree to pay, indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, each Lender at any time party hereto (whether or not such Lender remains a party hereto) and each of their respective Related Persons (without duplication) (each such Person being an “Indemnitee”) from and against all Liabilities that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such Indemnitee and the reasonable and documented or invoiced out-of-pocket expenses to which such Indemnitee may become subject, in each case to the extent of any such Liabilities and related expenses, to the extent arising out of, or resulting from, or in connection with the Loan Documents, the use or proposed use of proceeds of any Loan or any Proceeding (regardless of whether such Indemnitee is a party thereto or whether or not such Proceeding was brought by any Borrower, their equityholders, Affiliates or creditors or any other third Person) and to reimburse each such Indemnitee promptly for any reasonable and documented or invoiced out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred in connection with investigating, responding to or defending any of the foregoing (which, in the case of Attorney Costs, shall be limited to (x) Attorney Costs of one firm of counsel for the Agent and its respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives, (y) Attorney Costs of one firm of counsel for the Lenders and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors, and other representatives (it being understood such counsel shall initially be Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP) and, (z) if reasonably necessary, Attorney Costs of a single firm of local counsel in each appropriate jurisdiction (which may include a single firm of special counsel acting in multiple jurisdictions) (and, in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest where the indemnitee affected by such conflict notifies the Borrowers of the existence of such conflict and in connection with the investigating, responding to or defending any of the foregoing has retained its own counsel, of one other firm of counsel and, if reasonably necessary, on additional firm of local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction for such similarly situated affected Indemnitees)), in each case relating to the Transactions or the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or the use or proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans (all the foregoing in this clause (b), collectively, the “Indemnified Matters”); provided that this clause (b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent Liabilities arising from any non-Tax claim; and provided, further, that the Borrowers shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee with respect to Indemnified Matters to the extent arising from (i) the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or any of its Related Indemnified Persons as determined in a final and non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, (ii) a material breach of the obligations of such Indemnitee or any of its Related Indemnified Persons under the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by such Indemnitee or any of its Related Indemnified Persons as determined in a final and non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction or (iii) any Proceeding brought by any Indemnitee against any other Indemnitee that does not involve an act or omission by the Borrowers or their Subsidiaries; provided that the Agent, to the extent fulfilling its role in its capacities as such, shall remain indemnified in respect of such a Proceeding, to the extent that none of the exceptions set forth in clause (i) or (ii) of the immediately preceding proviso applies to such Person at such time.
(ii)           No Loan Party shall be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without written consent of the Borrowers, but if settled with the Borrowers’ written consent or if there is a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction in any such Proceeding, each Credit Party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee from and against any and all Liabilities and reasonable and documented or invoiced legal or other out-of-pocket expenses by reason of such settlement or judgment in accordance with and to the extent provided in the other provisions of this Section 9.03. If any Person has reimbursed any Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses in accordance with such request and there is a final and non-appealable determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Indemnitee was not entitled to indemnification or contribution rights with respect to such payment pursuant to this Section 9.03, then the Indemnitee shall promptly refund such amount.
(iii)           No Loan Party shall without the prior written consent of any Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, it being understood that the withholding of consent due to non-satisfaction of any of the conditions described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this sentence shall be deemed reasonable), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of which indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnitee unless such settlement (i) includes a full and unconditional release of such Indemnitee in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee from all liability or claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding, (ii) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability, wrongdoing or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnitee, and (iii) includes customary confidentiality and non-disparagement agreements.</div>

Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Agents and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
(b)            (i)           Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraphs (b)(ii) and (g) below, any Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees (provided that, no assignments to any Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries or any Affiliates thereof are permitted) with the prior written consent of the Borrowers (only with respect to assignments to competitors of the Borrowers), provided that no consent of the Borrowers shall be required for any other assignment.
(ii)           Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:
(A)          except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment or Loans of any Class, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the trade date specified in the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment or, if no trade date is so specified, as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than, $1,000,000 (and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof), unless the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), provided that no such consent of the Borrowers shall be required if an Event of Default under Section 7.01(a), (b), (h) or (i) has occurred and is continuing,
(B)           each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, provided that this subclause (B) shall not be construed to prohibit assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations in respect of one Class of Commitments or Loans,
(C)           the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption (which shall include a representation by the assignee that it meets all the requirements to be an Eligible Assignee), together (unless waived by the Administrative Agent) with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, provided that assignments made pursuant to Section 2.19(b) or Section 9.02(c) shall not require the signature of the assigning Lender to become effective; and
(D)           the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent any tax forms required by Section 2.17(f) and an Administrative Questionnaire in which the assignee designates one or more credit contacts to whom all syndicate-level information (which may contain material non-public information about the Borrowers, the Loan Parties and their Related Parties or their respective securities) will be made available and who may receive such information in accordance with the assignee’s compliance procedures and applicable laws, including Federal and state securities laws and
(E)           [reserved].
(iii)          Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(v) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of (and subject to the obligations and limitations of) Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 and to any fees payable hereunder that have accrued for such Lender’s account but have not yet been paid). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c)(i) of this Section.
(iv)          The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal and interest amounts of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and, solely with respect to its Loans or Commitments, any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(v)           Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee’s completed Administrative Questionnaire and any tax forms required by Section 2.17(f) (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph (b).
(vi)          The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature” and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
(c)            (i)            Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent sell participations to one or more banks or other Persons (other than to a Person that is not an Eligible Assignee ) (a “Participant”), provided that (A) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents, provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that directly and adversely affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender (subject to the requirements and limitations thereof, it being understood that any tax forms required by Section 2.17(f) shall be provided solely to the Lender that sold the participation) and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(b) as though it were a Lender.
(ii)           A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15 or Section 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers’ prior consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
(iii)          Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”), provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary in connection with a Tax audit or other proceeding to establish that such Commitment, Loan, or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive (absent manifest error), and each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register pursuant to the terms hereof shall be treated as a Participant for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.
(d)           Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest, provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
(e)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a “Granting Lender”) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an “SPV”), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, the option to provide to the Borrowers all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement, provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to make any Loan and (ii) if an SPV elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPV hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPV, such party will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPV any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.04, any SPV may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Borrowers and Administrative Agent) providing liquidity or credit support to or for the account of such SPV to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPV.</div>
