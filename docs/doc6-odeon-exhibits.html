Members of, or participants in, the Depository (“Agent Members”) shall have no rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global Note held on their behalf by the Depository or by the Securities Custodian or under such Global Note, and the Depository may be treated by the Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee as the absolute owner of such Global Note for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Issuer, the Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depository or impair, as between the Depository and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices of the Depository governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of a beneficial interest in any Global Note.

2.3            Transfer and Exchange. (a) Transfer and Exchange of Definitive Notes. When Definitive Notes are presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request:



(i)            to register the transfer of such Definitive Notes; or



(ii)            to exchange such Definitive Notes for an equal principal amount of Definitive Notes of other authorized denominations, the Registrar or co-registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested if its reasonable requirements for such transaction are met; provided, however, that the Definitive Notes surrendered for transfer or exchange:



(1)            shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer and the Registrar or co-registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing; and



(2)            are being transferred, or exchanged pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or pursuant to clause (A), (B) or (C) below, and are accompanied by the following additional information and documents, as applicable:









(A)            if such Definitive Notes are being delivered to the Registrar by a Holder for registration in the name of such Holder, without transfer, a certification from such Holder to that effect; or



(B)            if such Definitive Notes are being transferred to the Issuer, a certification to that effect; or



(C)            if such Definitive Notes are being transferred pursuant to an exemption from registration in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act or pursuant to or in compliance with an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act other than Rule 144, Rule 903 or Rule 904, (i) a certification to that effect and (ii) if the Issuer so requests, an Opinion of Counsel or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to it as to the compliance with the restrictions set forth in the legend set forth in Section 2.3(e)(i).



(b)            Restrictions on Transfer of a Definitive Note for a Beneficial Interest in a Global Note. A Definitive Note may not be exchanged for a beneficial interest in a Global Note except upon satisfaction of the requirements set forth below. Upon receipt by the Trustee of a Definitive Note, duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer and the Registrar, together with;



(i)            certification (in the form set forth on the reverse side of the Initial Note) that such Definitive Note is being transferred (1) to a QIB in accordance with Rule 144A or (2) outside the United States in an offshore transaction within the meaning of Regulation S and in compliance with Rule 904 under the Securities Act, which certification shall be accompanied by a signed letter substantially in the form of Exhibit B; and



(ii)            written instructions directing the Trustee to make, or to direct the Securities Custodian to make, an adjustment on its books and records with respect to such Global Note to reflect an increase in the aggregate principal amount of the Note represented by the Global Note, such instructions to contain information regarding the Depository to be credited with such increase,



then the Trustee shall cancel such Definitive Note and cause, or direct the Securities Custodian to cause, in accordance with the standing instructions and procedures existing between the Depository and the Securities Custodian, the aggregate principal amount of Notes represented by the Global Note to be increased by the aggregate principal amount of the Definitive Note to be exchanged and shall credit or cause to be credited to the account of the Person specified in such instructions a beneficial interest in the Global Note equal to the principal amount of the Definitive Note so canceled. If no Global Notes are then outstanding and the Global Note has not been previously exchanged for certificated securities pursuant to Section 2.4, the Issuer shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate, upon written order of the Issuer in the form of an Officers’ Certificate, a new Global Note in the appropriate principal amount.









(c)            Transfer and Exchange of Global Notes.



(i)            The transfer and exchange of Global Notes or beneficial interests therein shall be effected through the Depository in accordance with this Indenture (including applicable restrictions on transfer set forth herein, if any) and the procedures of the Depository therefor. A transferor of a beneficial interest in a Global Note shall deliver a written order given in accordance with the procedures of the Depository containing information regarding the participant account of the Depository to be credited with a beneficial interest in the Global Note and such account shall be credited in accordance with such instructions with a beneficial interest in the Global Note and the account of the Person making the transfer shall be debited by an amount equal to the beneficial interest in the Global Note being transferred. Transfers by an owner of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note to a transferee who takes delivery of such interest through the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, shall be made only upon receipt by the Trustee of a certification in the form provided on the reverse of the Initial Notes from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or (if available) Rule 144 under the Securities Act or pursuant to or in compliance with an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act other than Rule 144, Rule 903 or Rule 904 and that, if such transfer is being made prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, the interest transferred shall be held immediately thereafter through Euroclear or Clearstream.



(ii)            If the proposed transfer is a transfer of a beneficial interest in one Global Note to a beneficial interest in another Global Note, the Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date and an increase in the principal amount of the Global Note to which such interest is being transferred in an amount equal to the principal amount of the interest to be so transferred, and the Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date and a corresponding decrease in the principal amount of Global Note from which such interest is being transferred.



(iii)            Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Exhibit A (other than the provisions set forth in Section 2.4), a Global Note may not be transferred as a whole except by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository or by the Depository or any such nominee to a successor depository or a nominee of such successor depository.



(iv)            In the event that a Global Note is exchanged for Notes in definitive registered form pursuant to Section 2.4, such Notes may be exchanged only in accordance with such procedures as are substantially consistent with the provisions of this Section 2.3 (including the certification requirements set forth on the reverse, of the Initial Notes or Additional Notes intended to ensure that such transfers comply with Rule 144A, Regulation S or such other applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act, as the case may be) and such other procedures as may from time to time be adopted by the Issuer.



(d)            Restrictions on Transfer of Regulation S Global Note. (i) Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, interests in the Regulation S Global Note may only be held through Euroclear or Clearstream. During the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial ownership interests in the Regulation S Global Note may only be sold, pledged or transferred through Euroclear or Clearstream in accordance with the Applicable Procedures and only (1) so long as such security is eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person whom the selling holder reasonably believes is a QIB that purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the resale, pledge or transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (2) in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S, (3) pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act provided by Rule 144 (if applicable) under the Securities Act, or (4) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, in each case in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States. Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, transfers by an owner of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note to a transferee who takes delivery of such interest through the Rule 144A Global Note shall be made only in accordance with Applicable Procedures and upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification from the transferor of the beneficial interest in the form provided on the reverse of the Initial Notes to the effect that such transfer is being made to a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A. Such written certification shall no longer be required after the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period.









(ii)            Upon the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial ownership interests in the Regulation S Global Note shall be transferable in accordance with applicable law and the other terms of this Indenture.



(e)            Legend.

Prior to November 1, 2024 the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes at a redemption price of 112.75% of the principal amount thereof with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided that:



(1)              at least 65% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Initial Notes remains outstanding after each such redemption; and



(2)              the redemption occurs within 120 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.



In addition, at any time and from time to time prior to November 1, 2024, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Premium with respect to the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date. Notice of such redemption must be sent to Holders of the Notes called for redemption not less than 10 or more than 60 days prior to the redemption date. The notice need not set forth the Applicable Premium but only the manner of calculation of the redemption price. The Indenture provides that, with respect to any such redemption, the Issuer will notify the Trustee of the Applicable Premium with respect to the Notes promptly after the calculation and that the Trustee will not be responsible for such calculation.









The Issuer may redeem the Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture, and a single notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions. Any such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different provisions will have different redemption dates and, with respect to redemptions that occur on the same date, may specify the order in which such redemptions are deemed to occur. In addition, notice of any redemption of, or any offer to purchase, the Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given in connection with an Equity Offering, other transaction (or series of related transactions) or an event that constitutes a Change of Control and prior to the completion or the occurrence thereof, and any such redemption or purchase may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion or occurrence of the related Equity Offering, transaction or event, as the case may be. In addition, if such redemption or purchase is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date or purchase date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase was mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the redemption date or purchase date or by the redemption date or purchase date as so delayed, or such notice or offer may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s discretion if the Issuer reasonably believes that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice or offer that payment of the redemption or purchase price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption or offer to purchase may be performed by another Person.



If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.



On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.



7.               Sinking Fund



The Notes are not subject to any sinking fund.



8.               Notice of Redemption



Notice of redemption shall be sent to the holders electronically or by first class mail, with a copy to the Trustee or the Registrar, as applicable, to each holder of Notes to the address of such holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of the Depository not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date. Notice of any redemption upon any Equity Offering may be given prior to the completion of the related Equity Offering. Notes in denominations larger than $200,000 may be redeemed in part but only in integral multiples of $1,000. If money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on all Notes (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the redemption date is deposited with the Paying Agent on or before the redemption date and certain other conditions are satisfied, on and after such date interest ceases to accrue on such Notes (or such portions thereof) called for redemption.









9.               Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon Change of Control



Upon a Change of Control, the Issuer will be required to make an offer, subject to certain conditions specified in the Indenture, to repurchase all the Notes of each Holder at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of Notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the interest payment date that is on or prior to the date of purchase) as provided in, and subject to the terms of, the Indenture.



10.             Denominations; Transfer; Exchange



The Notes are in registered form in minimum denominations of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. Upon any transfer or exchange, the Registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any Notes selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Note to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Note not to be redeemed) or to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 10 days prior to a selection of Notes to be redeemed or 10 days before an interest payment date.



11.             Persons Deemed Owners



The registered Holder of this Note may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.



12.             Unclaimed Money



If money for the payment of principal, premium or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Issuer at its written request unless an abandoned property law designates another Person. After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the Issuer and not to the Trustee for payment.



13.             Discharge and Defeasance



Subject to certain conditions set forth in the Indenture, the Issuer at any time may terminate some of or all its obligations under the Notes and the Indenture if the Issuer deposits with the Trustee money or Government Securities for the payment of principal and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be.



14.             Amendment, Supplement and Waiver



The Indenture, the Notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees may be amended or supplemented as provided in the Indenture.



15.             Defaults and Remedies



If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, subject to certain limitations, may declare all the Notes to be immediately due and payable. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default and shall result in the Notes being immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of such Events of Default without any further act of the Trustee or any Holder.









Holders of Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Notes unless it receives reasonable indemnity or security. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power under the Indenture. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may rescind any declaration of acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree, and if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except non-payment of principal or interest that has become due solely because of the acceleration.



16.             Security.



The Notes will be secured by the Collateral on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Indenture and the Security Documents. The Trustee and the Security Agent, as the case may be, hold the Collateral in trust for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, in each case pursuant to the Security Documents. Each Holder, by accepting this Note, consents and agrees to the terms of the Security Documents (including the provisions providing for the foreclosure and release of Collateral) as the same may be in effect or may be amended from time to time in accordance with their terms and the Indenture and authorizes and directs the Security Agent to enter into the Security Documents on the Issue Date, and at any time after Issue Date, as applicable,

AGREED SECURITY PRINCIPLES



D-1



AGREED SECURITY PRINCIPLES



The parties have agreed and acknowledged that their rights and obligations in relation to this transaction in respect of (i) the giving or taking of guarantees; (ii) the giving or taking of security; and (iii) all the rights and obligations associated with such giving or taking of guarantees and security, shall be subject to and limited by the agreed security principles set out in this Schedule (the “Agreed Security Principles”).



1	Description of security


(a)	Subject to these Agreed Security Principles, the parties agree that the overriding intention is for security in respect of the Finance Documents only to be granted:


(i)	by each Obligor incorporated in England and Wales (A) by way of fixed charge over its shares, certain intellectual property (as described in sub-paragraph (iii) below), receivables, bank accounts, intercompany receivables, any hedging agreements, licenses, consents and agreements held by it in connection with the use of its assets and goodwill and uncalled capital and (B) by way of assignment of its material insurance policies;


(ii)	by each Obligor incorporated in Finland, Germany, Spain and Sweden over (A) shares it owns in any entity in accordance with sub-paragraph (v) below, (B) any intercompany receivables and (C) bank accounts (without control over use and, in relation to Spanish law governed bank account pledges, without control over use until a Declared Default occurs);


(iii)	by each relevant Obligor incorporated in (A) England and Wales over its intellectual property in the Odeon brand; (B) Sweden over its intellectual property in the Filmstaden brand; (C) Germany, namely United Cinemas International Multiplex GmbH over its intellectual property in the UCI brand; and (D) Finland over its intellectual property in the Finnkino brand;


(iv)	using commercially reasonable efforts, by each Obligor (other than in relation to any Obligor incorporated under the laws of Germany or Ireland) over certain rights under (i) lease agreements and (ii) loyalty agreements (“Contracts”), provided that, without prejudice to paragraph 2(e) below, in each case, such security is permitted under the terms of the relevant Contract and any law or regulation applicable to the relevant Obligor; and


(v)	over shares in: (A) each Obligor incorporated in England and Wales (including the shares of Odeon Cinemas Group Limited pursuant to a third party share pledge) and (B) NCG Holding AB, Filmstaden AB, Filmstaden Media AB, United Cinemas International Multiplex GmbH, United Cinemas International Novoplex GmbH, United Cinemas International Kinoplex GmbH, Cinesa – Compañía de Iniciativas y Espectáculos, S.A. and Finnkino Oy (the “Transaction Share Pledges”),


and that no other security shall be required to be given by any other person or in relation to any other asset, save, in each case, as provided in paragraph (b) below (the “Overriding Principle”).



D-2



(b)	Obligors incorporated in England and Wales and Finland will grant a customary floating charge over all or substantially all of their assets located in their jurisdiction of incorporation, subject to customary carve-outs, which are required as a matter of law and/or contractual arrangements which impose restrictions on the provision of security over certain assets, in accordance with and subject to these Agreed Security Principles. In respect of any floating charge provided in Finland, the relevant Obligor will deliver an original signed business mortgage promissory note to the Finnish Patent and Registration Authority (or the Finnish legal counsel of the Security Agent) without undue delay after the security over the relevant intellectual property rights has been registered.


2	Certain Principles


The Agreed Security Principles embody the recognition by all parties that there may be certain legal and practical difficulties in obtaining effective or commercially reasonable guarantees and security from UK Newco and all members of the Group in which it has been agreed that guarantees and security will be granted by UK Newco (for the avoidance of doubt, UK Newco is not and will not be a Guarantor) and those members. In particular:



(a)	general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, equity subordination, detrimental transactions and management insolvency liability rules, fraudulent preference, limitations of the granting of guarantee by holding companies, “interest stripping”, “earnings stripping”, “controlled foreign corporation”, transfer pricing or “thin capitalisation” rules, tax restrictions, exchange control restrictions, capital maintenance rules and “liquidity impairment” rules, retention of title claims and similar principles may prohibit, limit or otherwise restrict the ability of a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be limited by an amount or otherwise. The Company and/or relevant security and/or guarantee provider will use reasonable efforts to assist in demonstrating that adequate corporate benefit accrues to each guarantor of guarantees and security. If any such limit applies, the guarantees and security provided (or the enforceability thereof) will be subject to customary limitation language and limited to the maximum amount which the relevant member of the Group may provide having regard to applicable law (including any jurisprudence) and the rules and principles outlined above and subject to fiduciary and applicable legal duties of management;


(b)	certain supervisory board, works council, regulator or regulatory board (or equivalent), or another external body’s or person’s consent, approval or advice may be required to enable a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or security. Such guarantee and/or security shall not be required unless such consent has been received provided that reasonable efforts have been used by the relevant member of the Group to obtain the relevant consent or advice to the extent permissible by law, regulation and custom and such consent has no material adverse impact on relationships with third parties;


(c)	the giving of a guarantee, the granting and the terms of security or the perfection of the security granted will not be required to the extent that it would, as reasonably determined by the Company, incur any legal fees, registration fees, notarisation and registration fees, stamp duty, taxes (including any corporate tax applicable to any guarantee fee that may due under applicable transfer pricing regulations) and any other fees or costs directly associated with such security or guarantee or limit the deductibility of interest expenses in amounts which are disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the Finance Parties;


D-3



(d)	where there is material incremental cost involved in creating security over all assets owned by an Obligor in a particular category the principle stated at paragraph (c) above shall apply and, subject to these Agreed Security Principles, only the material assets in that category shall be subject to security;


(e)	any assets subject to a legal requirement (including any requirement to obtain consent from customers pursuant to applicable data protection laws or regulations), contract, lease, licence, instrument, regulatory constraint (including any agreement with any government or regulatory body) or other third party arrangements (including shareholder agreements, joint venture agreements and cash pool arrangements relating to bank accounts) which may prevent those assets from being charged or assigned (or assets which, if charged or assigned, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations of the Group in respect of those assets) will be excluded from any relevant security document and any requirement to give security or guarantee provided that, if the relevant asset is material and the Company determines (acting reasonably) that such efforts will not jeopardise commercial relationships with third parties, the relevant member of the Group will use reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary consent or waiver within forty five (45) days, provided further that if the relevant member of the Group has not been able to obtain such consent or waver, its obligation to obtain any consent or waiver will cease on the expiry of that forty five (45) day period;


(f)	members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into Transaction Security Documents if (i) it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group to do so (ii) it results in the security document being null and void, or (iii) it would conflict with the fiduciary and legal duties of their directors, officers or employees, contravene any legal or regulatory prohibition, or regulatory condition or result in a risk of personal civil or criminal liability on the part of any director, officer or employee. The Security Agent or the other secured parties, as the case may be, shall discharge any guarantees and release any security which is or are subject to any legal or regulatory prohibition as is referred to in this paragraph as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware of such prohibition;


(g)	the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security or the perfection of security granted will not be required if it would be unduly burdensome or restrict the ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course or as otherwise permitted by the Finance Documents and any requirement under these Agreed Security Principles to seek the consent of any person or to take or not take any other action shall be subject to this paragraph (g);


(h)	it is acknowledged that in certain jurisdictions, it may be impossible, impractical, or disproportionately costly to create guarantees or security over certain categories of assets, in which event guarantees or security will not be taken over such assets;


(i)	the security will be first ranking, to the extent possible, subject to any non-consensual liens and other liens mandatorily preferred by any applicable law and permitted under the Finance Documents;


(j)	information, such as lists of assets (including, without limitation, receivables), will be provided if, and only to the extent, required by local law to be provided to perfect or register the relevant security interests and when required, unless required to be provided by local law more frequently, will be provided annually or, following an Event of Default which is continuing, at the Security Agent’s reasonable request;


D-4



(k)	the maximum guaranteed or secured amount may be limited to minimise stamp duty, notarisation, registration or other applicable fees, taxes and duties where the benefit of increasing the guaranteed or secured amount is disproportionate to the level of such fees, taxes and duties (and, in any event, the maximum aggregate amount payable by the Group in respect of fees, costs, expenses, disbursements and VAT relating to the provision of guarantees and security shall be limited to an amount to be agreed between the Security Agent and the Company);


(l)	no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where Obligors are not incorporated but perfection action may be required in respect of the Transaction Share Pledges in the jurisdiction of incorporation of the entity whose shares are being charged;


(m)	all security (other than share security, which shall in each case be subject in all respects to paragraph 7 below) shall be governed by the law of and secure assets located in the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Obligor;


(n)	subject to paragraph 4(c) below, the Security Agent will hold one set of security interests for the Secured Obligations (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) to the extent reasonably practicable taking into account local law considerations;


(o)	no guarantee or security will be required from or over ownership interests in, or over the assets of, (i) any entity incorporated in an Excluded Jurisdiction or (ii) any joint venture or similar arrangement or any company in which a member of the Group owns a minority interest;


(p)	security shall not be created to the extent that it would result in a Lender becoming subject to German non-resident tax liability as regards interest payable under a Facility and/or trigger a German withholding tax deduction (including any withholding tax deduction upon issuance of an administrative order by the competent German tax authorities), unless in each case such taxes are for the account of the relevant Lender and are not subject to any indemnification or gross- up obligation by any Obligor;


(q)	members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if they are not wholly owned by another member or members of the Group and no member of the Group will be required to grant security over shares in any entity which is not wholly-owned by members of the Group; and


(r)	no member of the Group that is subject to a license under any law or regulation that would prohibit or materially restrict the granting of security or giving of guarantees shall be required to grant any security or give any guarantees, provided that reasonable efforts to obtain consent or waivers from any relevant party shall be used by the relevant member of the Group if the relevant member of the Group is an Obligor and if, in the view of the Company (acting reasonably), granting such security or giving such guarantee will have no material adverse impact on relationships with third parties or otherwise force the relevant member of the Group or the Group to incur any material cost.


D-5



3	Terms of Guarantee and Security Documents


The following principles will be reflected in the terms of any guarantee and or security taken as part of this transaction:



(a)	security will not be enforceable or crystallise until the giving of notice by the Agent under paragraph (a) of Clause 23.16 (Acceleration) or by virtue of an automatic acceleration pursuant to paragraph (b) of Clause 23.16 (Acceleration) (a “Declared Default”);


(b)	subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, no claims will be made under guarantees, and security will not be enforceable, until the occurrence of a Declared Default;


(c)	no notices (and/or acknowledgement) of pledges or security interests will need to be delivered to third parties until the occurrence of a Declared Default (unless under the law applicable to such security, such notice (and/or acknowledgement) is required to be delivered in order to create or perfect the security and such notice (and/or acknowledgement) continues to allow the Obligor to freely deal with the relevant asset);


(d)	each security document (other than security documents which are required to be notarized in order to be valid and/or enforceable and may not consequently contain such a provision) will, to the extent legally possible under the law of the relevant jurisdiction, contain a clause which records that if there is a conflict between the security document and the Intercreditor Agreement then (to the extent permitted by law) the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement shall take priority over the provisions of the security document;


(e)	the Security Agent will not have any rights to vote any of the shares held by the Group which are pledged to them or to block any funds being transferred between Group members prior to the date on which a Declared Default has occurred;


(f)	the security documents will not be unduly burdensome on the Obligor or interfere unreasonably with the operation of its business and should only operate to create or perfect security rather than to impose new commercial obligations;


(g)	with the exception of the tax and/or costs provisions which is advisable and/or required by law to repeat and/or include in the Transaction Security Documents governed by Italian law and/or to be perfected in Italy, in the Transaction Security Documents there will be no repetition or extension of clauses set out in the Finance Documents such as those relating to notices, access, cost and expenses, indemnities, tax gross up, distribution of proceeds and release of security; representations and undertakings shall be included in the security documents only to the extent relating to title or required by local law in order to create or perfect or ensure the priority of the security interest expressed to be created thereby (to the extent perfection is required by these Agreed Security Principles) (including customary provisions relating to the creation or perfection of security over the relevant class of assets);


(h)	representations in any Transaction Security Document shall be given only on the date on which such security document is executed and shall not otherwise repeat;


(i)	the Security Agent shall only be able to exercise any power of attorney granted to it under the security documents following the occurrence of a Declared Default;


(j)	the Transaction Security Documents should not operate so as to prevent transactions which are permitted under the Finance Documents or to require additional consents or authorisations;


(k)	where an Obligor is free to dispose of an asset forming part of the Transaction Security pursuant to the terms of the Finance Documents, the Security Agent is under an obligation to release such asset upon request by the Company and will be entitled to do so without the consent of any other Finance Party;


D-6



(l)	the Transaction Security Documents will not accrue interest on any amount in respect of which interest is accruing under the Finance Documents;


(m)	any rights of set off will not be exercisable until the occurrence of a Declared Default. Such rights shall apply only to reciprocal matured obligations due and payable to any Finance Party by an Obligor under a Finance Document;


(n)	the security documents will, where possible and practical, automatically create security over future assets of the same type as those already secured; where local law requires supplemental pledges to be delivered in respect of future acquired assets in order for effective security to be created over that class of asset, such supplemental pledges shall be provided at intervals no more frequently than annually (unless required more frequently under local law), except following a Declared Default;


(o)	no security will be taken over livestock, moveable plant, equipment or vehicles if it would require labelling, segregation, periodic listing, notification, mapping or specification of such livestock, moveable plant, equipment or vehicles prior to a Declared Default, unless required beforehand under local law in order to perfect the relevant security interests; and


(p)	no security governed by Italian law and/or granted by an entity incorporated in Italy shall secure the performance of obligations in violations of Italian mandatory rules, including, inter alia, any obligations to pay (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate permitted under the Italian Usury Law (i.e., Italian Law No. 108 of 7 March 1996, as subsequently amended, supplemented and implemented from time to time) and related implementing rules and regulations and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any compounding of interest which does not comply with Italian law.


4	Guarantees/Security

              <summary>View Full Text</summary>
              <div class="legal-text">Enforcement Principles



1.	In this Schedule 4:


Enforcement Objective means maximising, to the extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realisation of value, the value realised from Enforcement;



Fairness Opinion means, in respect of any Enforcement, an opinion from a Financial Adviser that the proceeds received or recovered in connection with that Enforcement are fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances;



Financial Adviser means any reputable, independent and internationally recognised investment bank, firm of accountants or third-party professional firm which is regularly engaged in such sale processes (and, in each case, not being an auditor or administrator or other relevant officer of the applicable company).



2.	Any Enforcement shall be consistent with the Enforcement Objective.


3.	Without prejudice to the Enforcement Objective, the Transaction Security will be enforced and other action as to Enforcement will be taken such that either:


(a)	to the extent the Instructing Group is the Majority Senior Creditors, all proceeds of Enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for distribution in accordance with Clause 18 (Application of Proceeds); or


(b)	to the extent the Instructing Group is the Majority Pari Passu Creditors, either:


(i)	all proceeds of enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for distribution in accordance with Clause 18 (Application of Proceeds); or


(ii)	sufficient proceeds from Enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that, when the proceeds are applied in accordance with Clause 18 (Application of Proceeds), the Super Senior Discharge Date will occur (unless the Majority Senior Creditors agree otherwise).


4.	On:


(a)	a proposed Enforcement in relation to assets comprising Charged Property other than shares in a Group Company over which Transaction Security exists, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds €2,500,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency or currencies); or


(b)	a proposed Enforcement in relation to Charged Property comprising some or all of the shares in a Group Company over which Transaction Security exists,


which, in either case, is not being effected through a Competitive Process, the Security Agent shall, if requested by the Majority Senior Creditors or the Majority Pari Passu Creditors, appoint a Financial Adviser to provide a Fairness Opinion in relation to that Enforcement, provided that the Security Agent shall not be required to appoint a Financial Adviser nor obtain a Fairness Opinion if a proposed Enforcement:



273





(i)	would result in the receipt of sufficient Enforcement Proceeds in cash by the Security Agent to ensure that, after application in accordance with Clause 18 (Application of Proceeds):


(A)	in the case of an Enforcement requested by the Majority Senior Creditors, the Final Discharge Date would occur; or


(B)	in the case of an Enforcement requested by the Majority Pari Passu Creditors, the Super Senior Discharge Date would occur;


(ii)	is in accordance with any applicable law; and


(iii)	complies with Clause 17.2 (Distressed Disposals).


5.	A Fairness Opinion shall not be required if a proposed Enforcement:


(i)	would result in the receipt of sufficient Enforcement Proceeds in cash by the Security Agent to ensure that:


(A) after application in accordance with Clause 18 (Application of Proceeds) in the case of an Enforcement by the Majority Senior Creditors, would result in the Senior Secured Discharge Date, and



(B) after application in accordance with Clause 18 (Application of Proceeds) in the case of an Enforcement requested by the Majority Pari Passu Creditors would result in the Super Senior Discharge Date;



(ii)	is in accordance with any applicable law; and


(iii)	complies with the provisions in this Agreement regarding a Distressed Disposal.


6.	The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Adviser or to seek the advice of a Financial Adviser unless expressly required to do so by this Schedule 4 or any other provision of this Agreement.


7.	The Fairness Opinion will be conclusive evidence that the Enforcement Objective has been met.
