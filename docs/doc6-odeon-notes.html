(iii)           testing availability under baskets set forth in this Indenture (including baskets measured as a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Total Assets or by reference to Section 4.07(a)(C) or the Excluded Contribution Amount); in each case, at the option of the Company (the Company’s election to exercise such option in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction, an “LCT Election”), with such option to be exercised on or prior to the date of execution of the definitive agreements related to such Limited Condition Transaction, the date of determination of whether any such action is permitted hereunder, shall be deemed to be the date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Transaction are entered into (the “LCT Test Date”), and if, after giving Pro Forma Effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they had occurred at the beginning of the most recent Test Period ending prior to the LCT Test Date, the Company could have taken such action on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio or basket, such ratio or basket shall be deemed to have been complied with.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company has made an LCT Election and any of the ratios or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio or basket, including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the Company or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or action, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations; however, if any ratios improve or baskets increase as a result of such fluctuations, such improved ratios or baskets may be utilized. If the Company has made an LCT Election for any Limited Condition Transaction, then in connection with any subsequent calculation of the incurrence ratios subject to the LCT Election on or following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of (i) the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or (ii) the date that the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated or expires without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio or basket shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming such Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated.</div>

(b)            For purposes of determining the permissibility of any action, change, transaction or event that requires a calculation of any financial ratio or test (including, without limitation, any First Lien Leverage Ratio test, any Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test and/or any Total Leverage Ratio test, the amount of Consolidated EBITDA and/or Consolidated Total Assets), such financial ratio or test shall be calculated at the time such action is taken (subject to Section 1.05), such change is made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the case may be, and no Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of a change in such financial ratio or test occurring after the time such action is taken, such change is made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the case may be.
(c)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision in any covenant (including any constituent definition thereof) of this Indenture that does not require compliance with a financial ratio or test (including, without limitation, any First Lien Leverage Ratio test, any Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test and/or any Total Leverage Ratio test) (any such amounts, the “Fixed Amounts”) substantially concurrently with any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of this Indenture that requires compliance with a financial ratio or test (including, without limitation, any First Lien Leverage Ratio test, any Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test and/or any Total Leverage Ratio test) (any such amounts, the “Incurrence-Based Amounts”), it is understood and agreed that the Fixed Amounts shall be disregarded in the calculation of the financial ratio or test applicable to the Incurrence-Based Amounts.

For purposes of any determination of Consolidated Total Debt, amounts in currencies other than U.S. Dollars shall be translated into U.S. Dollars at the currency exchange rates used in preparing the most recently delivered financial statements pursuant to Section 4.13 (or, prior to the first such delivery, the most recent internally available financial statements).</div>

<p><strong>The Notes.</strong> Governs the issuance mechanics for the Odeon 12.750% Senior Secured Notes, including form, authentication, paying agent designation, and cancellation procedures. These are $400M face value notes issued by Odeon Finco PLC, a UK entity, making this the only non-US issuance in AMC's capital structure. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The UK issuer structure introduces cross-border complexity in enforcement, taxation, and collateral administration not present in DOC 2-5 and DOC 7.</p>

<p><strong>Amount of Notes; Issuable in Series.</strong> Authorizes the issuance of $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of notes, with the ability to issue additional notes of the same or different series. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Additional note capacity could increase total claims on Odeon's already strained asset base, though the indebtedness covenant severely limits new issuances given Odeon's 0.29x interest coverage.</p>

              <div class="legal-text">As provided for in Exhibit A hereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes which may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture is unlimited. All Notes shall be substantially identical in all respects other than issue prices, issuance dates, first interest payment amount, first interest payment date and denominations. Additional Notes may be issued from time to time by the Issuer without notice to or consent of the Holders and shall be consolidated with and form a single class with the Initial Notes; provided, such Additional Notes will not be issued with the same ISIN and CUSIP numbers as the Initial Notes unless such Additional Notes are fungible with the Initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes; provided, further, that the Issuer’s ability to issue Additional Notes shall be subject to the Issuer’s compliance with Section 4.06 and Section 4.08. All Notes issued under this Indenture shall be treated as a single class for all purposes of this Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase.
Subject to Section 2.03, the Trustee shall authenticate the Initial Notes for original issue on the Issue Date in the aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000. With respect to any Notes issued after the Issue Date (except for Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for, or in lieu of, Initial Notes pursuant to Section 2.07, 2.09 or 3.06 or Exhibit A), there shall be established in or pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors, and subject to Section 2.03, set forth, or determined in the manner provided in an Officers’ Certificate, or established in one or more indentures supplemental hereto, prior to the issuance of such Notes:
(a)            whether such Notes shall be issued as part of a new or existing series of Notes and the title of such Notes (which shall distinguish the Notes of the series from Notes of any other series);
(b)            the aggregate principal amount of such Notes that may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture (which shall be calculated without reference to any Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Notes of the same series pursuant to Section 2.07, 2.09 or 3.06 or Exhibit A or any Notes which, pursuant to Section 2.03, are deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder);
(c)            the issue price and issuance date of such Notes, including the date from which interest on such Notes shall accrue; and
(d)            if applicable, that such Notes shall be issuable in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Notes and, in such case, the respective depositories for such Global Notes, the form of any legend or legends that shall be borne by any such Global Notes in addition to or in lieu of that set forth in Appendix I to Exhibit A and any circumstances in addition to or in lieu of those set forth in Section 2.3 of Exhibit A in which any such Global Notes may be exchanged in whole or in part for Notes registered, and any transfer of such Global Notes in whole or in part may be registered, in the name or names of Persons other than the depository for such Global Note or a nominee thereof.
If any of the terms of any series are established by action taken pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officers’ Certificate or the trust indenture supplemental hereto setting forth the terms of the series.</div>

A Note shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the Note. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Note has been authenticated under this Indenture.
The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent reasonably acceptable to the Issuer to authenticate the Notes. Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Notes whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as any Registrar, Paying Agent or agent for service of notices and demands.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders of the Notes. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.
The Issuer shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Registrar, Paying Agent or transfer agent not a party to this Indenture. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such agent. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee of the name and address of any such agent. If the Issuer fails to maintain a Registrar, Paying Agent or transfer agent, the Trustee shall act as such and shall be entitled to appropriate compensation therefor pursuant to Section 7.07. The Issuer or any of its domestic Wholly Owned Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent.</div>

In addition, if such redemption or purchase is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date or purchase date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase was mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the redemption date or purchase date or by the redemption date or purchase date as so delayed, or such notice or offer may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s discretion if the Issuer reasonably believes that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice or offer that payment of the redemption or purchase price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption or offer to purchase may be performed by another Person.
If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange of the Channel Islands (the “Exchange”) and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of such redemption and, in addition to such notification, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, mail, or at the expense of the Issuer, cause to be mailed, such notice to Holders of Definitive Registered Notes by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar. For Notes which are held in Global Note form held on behalf of DTC, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to DTC for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC.
The notice shall identify the Notes (or portion thereof) to be redeemed (including CUSIP numbers if any) and shall state:
(a)           the redemption date;
(b)           the redemption price;
(c)           the name and address of the Paying Agent;
(d)           that Notes called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price;
(e)           if fewer than all the outstanding Notes are to be redeemed, or if a Note is to be redeemed in part only, the identification and principal amounts of the particular Notes (or portion thereof) to be redeemed;
(f)            that, unless the Issuer defaults in making such redemption payment or the Paying Agent is prohibited from making such payment pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, interest on Notes (or portion thereof) called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the redemption date;
(g)           that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the Notes; and
(h)           any conditions to such redemption.
At the Issuer’s written request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the Issuer’s name and at the Issuer’s expense. In such event, the Issuer shall provide the Trustee with the information required by this Section at least 2 Business Days before the redemption date, unless the Trustee consents to a shorter period.</div>

<p><strong>Redemption for Taxation Reasons.</strong> A provision unique to this international issuance. If changes in UK/European tax law require the Issuer (Odeon Finco PLC) to pay Additional Amounts on the notes due to withholding taxes, the Issuer may redeem all notes at <strong>100% of principal plus accrued interest plus any Additional Amounts</strong>. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Post-Brexit UK tax changes or changes in tax treaties could trigger this provision. It protects both the issuer (from indefinite increased costs) and holders (who receive par plus compensation for the tax burden).</p>

              <div class="legal-text">The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) and all Additional Amounts, if any, then due and that will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:
(1)            any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations, protocols, or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation, which has not been publicly announced before and becomes effective on or after the date of this Indenture (or, if a Tax jurisdiction was not a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction on the Issue Date, the date on which such jurisdiction became a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction under this Indenture); or
(2)            any amendment to, or change in existing official written position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations, protocols or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice), which has not been publicly announced before and becomes effective on or after the date of this Indenture (or, if a Tax jurisdiction was not a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction on the Issue Date, the date on which such jurisdiction became a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction under this Indenture) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),
the Issuer or any Guarantor (including, in each case, any successor entity) with respect to any Guarantee, as the case may be, is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts (but in the case of any Guarantor, only if such amount payable cannot be paid by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can pay such amount without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Issuer or such Guarantor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable).
Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under Sections 3.02, 3.03 and 3.04. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor (as defined below) would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay (at the time of the related payment) such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an opinion from an unaffiliated third-party counsel of recognized standing, to the effect that there has been such change or amendment which would entitle the Issuer to redeem the notes hereunder. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Registrar, the Trustee and the relevant Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied. The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.</div>

(1)            any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner of, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, but not limited to, being a citizen or resident (including for tax purposes) or national or domiciliary of, carrying on a trade or business therein, or having a permanent establishment, a dependent agent, a place of business or a place of management in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or Guarantee or the enforcement of rights or receipt of payment under or in respect of a Note or Guarantee;
(2)            any Taxes that are imposed, withheld or deducted by reason of any failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or the beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (and in any event at least 30 days before any such Taxes would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements relating to such matters, in each case, required by any applicable law, regulation, treaty or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or a reduction in the rate of, such Tax (provided, in each case, the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to do so);
(3)           any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee;
(4)            any estate, inheritance, gift, value added, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;
(5)           any Taxes imposed, withheld or deducted under or in connection with Sections 1471-1474 of the Code as of the Issue Date (or any substantially similar successor version of such sections that is substantively comparable) and regulations or official interpretations thereunder, any intergovernmental agreement between the United States and any other jurisdiction implementing or relating to FATCA or any similar non-U.S. law, regulation or guidance enacted or issued with respect to such intergovernmental agreement (“FATCA”);
(6)            any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) by or on behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the relevant Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another paying agent;
(7)           any Taxes which would not have been imposed if the Holder had presented the Note for payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 30 days after the date on which the relevant payment was first made available for payment to the Holder (except for Additional Amounts with respect to Taxes that would have been imposed had the Holder presented the Note for payment within such 30-day period);
(8)            any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment to a Holder that is a fiduciary or partnership or any Person other than the beneficial owner of such payment or Note, to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a member of such partnership or the beneficial owner of such payment or Note would not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the actual Holder of such Note;
(9)            any withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer) currently levied in the Federal Republic of Germany at the level of a custodian bank acting on behalf of the Holder (including solidarity surcharge (Solidaritätszuschlag) and church tax (Kirchensteuer), if any, imposed thereon); or
(10)            any combination of the above.
The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such certified copies as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent. The Payor will attach to each such certified copy of such payments a certificate stating that the amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding.
If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.
The Payor will pay the Holder or beneficial owner any present or future stamp, issue, registration, transfer, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties and any other reasonable expenses with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes, charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties and any other reasonable expenses with respect thereto) that arise in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (in the case of enforcement, any jurisdiction) from or in connection with the execution, issuance, delivery, registration or enforcement of any Notes, the Guarantees, this Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, (A) in connection with a transfer of the Notes (or any rights in or relating to them) after the Issue Date or (B) to the extent that such stamp, issue registration court or documentary taxes, or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies becomes payable upon a voluntary registration or filing made by the Holder if such registration or filing is not required by any applicable law or not necessary to enforce the rights or obligations of any Holder in relation to the Notes, any Guarantees, this Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any other document or instrument in relation thereto), and the Payor agrees to indemnify the Holders for any such taxes, charges or levies paid by such Holders or beneficial owners of the Notes.
Whenever this Indenture mentions the payment of amounts based on the principal amount, interest of any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Notes or any Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of this Indenture, and any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is incorporated, organized, carrying on a business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein having the power to tax or any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee.</div>

The notice shall contain all instructions and materials necessary to enable such Holders to tender Notes pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer, as the case may be. The Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer, as the case may be, shall be made to all Holders and, if required or permitted by the terms thereof, holders of other First Lien Obligations and, to the extent that the assets and property disposed of in the Asset Sale were not Collateral, any other Pari Passu Indebtedness. The notice, which shall govern the terms of the Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer, as the case may be, shall state:
(i)            that the Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer, as the case may be, is being made pursuant to this Section 3.10 and Section 4.17 and the length of time the Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer, as the case may be, shall remain open;
(ii)            the Offer Amount, the purchase price and the Purchase Date;
(iii)            that any Note not tendered or accepted for payment shall continue to accrue interest;
(iv)            that, unless the Issuer defaults in making such payment, any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer, as the case may be, shall cease to accrue interest after the Purchase Date;
(v)            that Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer, as the case may be, may elect to have Notes purchased in amounts of $1,000 or whole multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof only;
(vi)            that Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to any Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer, as the case may be, shall be required to surrender the Note, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” attached to the Note completed, or transfer by book-entry transfer, to the Issuer, DTC, if appointed by the Issuer, or a Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice at least three days before the Purchase Date;
(vii)          that, if the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and, if applicable, other First Lien Obligations and, to the extent that the assets and property disposed of in the Asset Sale were not Collateral, other Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, surrendered by the holders thereof exceeds the Offer Amount, the Trustee shall select the Notes (subject to applicable DTC procedures as to Global Notes) and the Issuer or the representative of such other First Lien Obligations and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness shall select such other First Lien Obligations and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased or repaid on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal amount of the Notes or such other First Lien Obligations and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered (with such adjustments as may be deemed appropriate by the Trustee so that only Notes in denominations of $200,000, or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, shall be purchased; provided that no Notes of $200,000 or less can be redeemed or purchased in part, except that if all of the Notes of a Holder are to be redeemed or purchased, the entire outstanding amount of Notes of such Holder, even if not a multiple of $1,000, shall be redeemed or purchased); and
(viii)            that Holders whose Notes were purchased only in part shall be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered (or transferred by book-entry transfer) representing the same indebtedness to the extent not repurchased.
(e)            On or before the Purchase Date, the Issuer shall, to the extent lawful, (1) accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Offer Amount of Notes or portions thereof validly tendered pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer, as the case may be, or if less than the Offer Amount has been tendered, all Notes tendered and (2) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officers’ Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof so tendered.
(f)            The Issuer, DTC or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall promptly mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes properly tendered by such Holder and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer shall promptly issue a new Note, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, shall authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) such new Note to such Holder (it being understood that, notwithstanding anything in this Indenture to the contrary, no Opinion of Counsel or Officers’ Certificate is required for the Trustee to authenticate and mail or deliver such new Note) in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered representing the same indebtedness to the extent not repurchased; provided, that each such new Note shall be in a principal amount of $200,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. Any Note not so accepted shall be promptly mailed or delivered by the Issuer to the Holder thereof. The Issuer shall publicly announce the results of the Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer, as the case may be, on or as soon as practicable after the Purchase Date.
Other than as specifically provided in this Section 3.10 or Section 4.17, any purchase pursuant to this Section 3.10 shall be made pursuant to the applicable provisions of Sections 3.01 through 3.08.</div>

<p><strong>Covenants</strong> for the Odeon notes include the standard high-yield package plus several UK-specific provisions. Notable differences from the US indentures: (1) <strong>Maintenance of Listing (Sec 4.05)</strong> - requires maintaining listing on a recognized exchange; (2) <strong>Agreed Security Principles (Exhibit D)</strong> - UK-style security concept governing how collateral is taken; (3) <strong>Change of Control put right (Sec 4.12)</strong> at 101%; (4) broader <strong>Reports obligation (Sec 4.13)</strong> vs. simple "Financial Information" in US docs. The Security Agent (not "Collateral Agent") terminology reflects UK practice.</p>

<p><strong>Payment of Notes.</strong> The Issuer must pay principal and interest when due in US dollars. Despite being a UK issuer, the notes are denominated in USD, meaning Odeon bears the currency risk of generating revenue in pounds/euros while servicing dollar-denominated debt. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Currency mismatch adds another layer of risk for an already stressed issuer.</p>

<p><strong>Maintenance of Listing.</strong> The Issuer must use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the notes on a recognized stock exchange (typically the Irish Stock Exchange or Luxembourg Stock Exchange). <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Certain European institutional investors are required to hold only listed securities. Delisting could force selling, which would depress the notes' trading price. This covenant is found <strong>only in DOC 6</strong> among all AMC debt instruments.</p>

<p><strong>Limitation on Indebtedness.</strong> The Issuer and Restricted Subsidiaries may not incur additional Indebtedness unless the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is at least 2.00:1.00 (pro forma). <strong>Critical context:</strong> With Odeon EBITDA of only $15M against $400M of debt (26.67x leverage, 0.29x interest coverage), Odeon is deeply restricted from incurring any new debt outside the carved-out baskets. The $51M annual cash interest burden alone exceeds Odeon's entire EBITDA, making this covenant effectively a straitjacket.</p>

(B)            other than with respect to a Permitted Refinancing in respect of Indebtedness permitted pursuant to Section 4.06(a) and clauses (ii), (iii), (vi), (viii) or (xxviii) of this Section 4.06(b), Indebtedness resulting from such modification, refinancing, refunding, renewal or extension has a final maturity date equal to or later than the final maturity date of, and has a Weighted Average Life to Maturity equal to or greater than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of, the Indebtedness being modified, refinanced, refunded, renewed or extended (other than customary bridge loans),

For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that a Permitted Refinancing may constitute a portion of an issuance of Indebtedness in excess of the amount of such Permitted Refinancing; provided that such excess amount is otherwise permitted to be incurred under this Section 4.06. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that a Permitted Refinancing includes successive Permitted Refinancings of the same Indebtedness.
(xxiii)            [reserved];
(xxiv)            [reserved];
(xxv)          additional Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount, measured at the time of incurrence and after giving Pro Forma Effect thereto and the use of the proceeds thereof, not to exceed 100% of the aggregate amount of direct or indirect equity investments in cash or Cash Equivalents in the form of common Equity Interests, Qualified Equity Interests, or Subordinated Shareholder Funding, received by the Company or any Parent Entity after the Issue Date (to the extent contributed to the Company in the form of common Equity Interests, Qualified Equity Interests or Subordinated Shareholder Funding) to the extent not included as an Excluded Contribution Amount or applied to increase any other basket hereunder; provided that the amount of Indebtedness that may be incurred pursuant to the foregoing, together with any amounts incurred under clauses (viii), (xv) and (xxvi) of this Section 4.06(b) and Section 4.06(a), by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors shall not at any one time outstanding exceed the greater of $30,000,000 and 15.0% of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of any incurrence or issuance pursuant to this clause (xxv);
(xxvi)          Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; provided that the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness of which the primary obligor or a guarantor is a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor outstanding in reliance on this clause (xxvi) shall not exceed, at the time of incurrence thereof and after giving Pro Forma Effect thereto, the greater of $10,000,000 and 5% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended Test Period as of such time; provided, further that the amount of Indebtedness that may be incurred pursuant to the foregoing, together with any amounts incurred under clauses (viii), (xv) and (xxv) of this Section 4.06(b) and Section 4.06(a), by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors shall not at any one time outstanding exceed the greater of $30,000,000 and 15.0% of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of any incurrence or issuance pursuant to this clause (xxvi);

(xxix)            [reserved];
(xxx)            Indebtedness incurred by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to the extent that the net proceeds thereof are promptly deposited with the Trustee to satisfy and discharge the Notes or exercise the Company’s legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance options set forth in Article 8 in each case, in accordance with this Indenture; and
(xxxi)          Indebtedness incurred pursuant to, or in order to comply with, Section 8(a) of the German Act on Partial Retirement (Altersteilzeitgesetz), Section 7(b) and/or 7(e) of the Fourth Book of the German Social Security Code (Sozialgesetzbuch (IV)); and
(xxxii)            all premiums (if any), interest (including post-petition interest), fees, expenses, charges and additional or contingent interest on obligations described in clauses (i) through (xxxi) above.
(c)            [reserved].
(d)            For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 4.06, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Indebtedness described in this Section 4.06, the Company shall, in its sole discretion, classify and reclassify or later divide, classify or reclassify such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) and will only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one or more of the above clauses; provided that if any such portion of such Indebtedness could, based on the financial statements for such Test Period, have been incurred in reliance on Section 4.06(a), such portion of such Indebtedness shall automatically be reclassified as having been incurred under the applicable provisions of Section 4.06(a) (in each case, subject to satisfying any other applicable provision of Section 4.06(a) and, in the case of any such portion of such Indebtedness incurred by any Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor, to availability under the cap applicable therein to the incurrence of such Indebtedness by a non-Subsidiary Guarantor).
(e)            If Indebtedness originally incurred in reliance upon a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or the First Lien Leverage Ratio under Section 4.07(b)(i) is being refinanced under such clause and such refinancing would cause the maximum amount of Indebtedness thereunder to be exceeded at such time, then such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such additional Indebtedness will be deemed to have been incurred, and permitted to be incurred, under such Section 4.07(b)(i), so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of Indebtedness being refinanced plus amounts permitted by the next sentence. Any Refinancing Indebtedness and any Indebtedness incurred to Refinance Indebtedness incurred pursuant to Section 4.07(b)(i) shall be permitted to include additional Indebtedness incurred to pay premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, tax gross-up amounts and fees, costs and expenses (including upfront fees, original issue discount or similar fees) in connection with such Refinancing.
Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness or Disqualified Equity Interests will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or Disqualified Equity Interests for purposes of this Section 4.06.</div>

<p><strong>Limitation on Restricted Payments and Prepayments of Junior Financing.</strong> Prevents Odeon from upstreaming cash to AMC through dividends or other distributions. The builder basket and 50% CNI mechanics are similar to the US indentures. <strong>Structural significance:</strong> This is a key ring-fencing provision. Even though AMC guarantees these notes, Odeon's cash flow stays within the Odeon Group for debt service rather than leaking to the US parent. Given Odeon's 0.29x interest coverage, there is effectively no capacity for restricted payments.</p>

<p><strong>Change of Control.</strong> If a Change of Control occurs, each holder may require repurchase at <strong>101% of principal plus accrued interest</strong>. Change of Control is defined as (a) acquisition of more than 50% of voting stock of the Company (Odeon Cinemas Group) by a person other than AMC, or (b) sale of all or substantially all assets of Odeon. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> If AMC sells its European cinema operations, Odeon noteholders can force a put at 101. With Odeon notes trading at 103.58 (above par), holders would likely not exercise this put at current prices, but it provides downside protection.</p>

              <div class="legal-text">Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, unless the Issuer has previously or concurrently delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under Section 3.03, the Issuer will be required to make an offer (a “Change of Control Offer”) to purchase all outstanding Notes (as described in this Indenture) at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount (or such higher amount as the Company may determine (any Change of Control Offer at a higher amount, an “Alternate Offer”)) (such price, the “Change of Control Payment”) plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).
Within 60 days following the date upon which the Change of Control occurred, the Issuer must send, electronically or by first class mail to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of the Depository, a notice to each Holder of Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, which notice shall govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer. Such notice will state:
(1)                that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer;
(2)                the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 20 Business Days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); provided, that the Change of Control Payment Date shall be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date such notice is sent) as any or all such conditions referred to in clause (8) below shall be satisfied or waived;
(3)                that any Notes not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;
(4)                that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on all properly tendered Notes, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date;
(5)                that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;
(6)                until the close of business on the tenth Business Day after the date such notice is sent (or such later time and date as the Issuer may decide in its sole discretion) (such time and date, the “withdrawal deadline”), that Holders shall be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuer to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the withdrawal deadline, as electronic transmission (in PDF), a facsimile transmission or letter or other communication in accordance with the procedures of DTC setting forth the name of the Holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased;
(7)                that if less than all of such Holder’s Notes are tendered for purchase, such Holder will be issued new Notes (or, in the case of Global Notes, such Notes shall be reduced by such amount of Notes that the Holder has tendered) and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered (the unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to $200,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof);
(8)                if such notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control or such other conditions specified therein and describing each such condition, and, if applicable, stating that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the notice is mailed or delivered) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or that such purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that the Issuer reasonably believes that any or all such conditions (including the occurrence of such Change of Control) will not be satisfied or waived by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed; and
(9)                such other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with this Section 4.12, that a Holder must follow.
If a notice relating to a Change of Control Offer that is subject to one or more conditions precedent (other than the occurrence of a Change of Control) is later rescinded as described in clause (8) above as a result of the failure of such condition(s) to be satisfied or waived (or as a result of the Issuer reasonably believing that such will be the case), the offer described in such notice will not be deemed a valid “Change of Control Offer” for purposes of this Section.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:
(1)           accept for payment all Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
(2)          deposit with the relevant Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered;
(3)          deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;
(4)           in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and
(5)           in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.
If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the relevant Paying Agent will promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Paying Agent or an authentication agent appointed by the Trustee will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Note equal in aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that, subject to the provisions relating to any Additional Notes that may be issued in the future, each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.
The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party approved in writing by the Issuer makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer, (ii) a notice of redemption to the Holders of the Notes has been given pursuant to this Indenture pursuant to Section 3.03 herein or (iii) in the event that upon the consummation of such Change of Control, the Issuer defeases or discharges the Notes as provided for under Article Eight herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer.
If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party approved in writing by the Issuer making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice (except that such notice may be delivered or mailed more than 60 days prior to the redemption date or purchase date if the notice is subject to one or more conditions precedent as described therein and such date is delayed until such time as any and all such conditions are satisfied or waived), given not more than 60 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem (with respect to the Issuer) or purchase (with respect to a third party) all of the Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase on a date (the “Second Change of Control Payment Date”) at a price in cash equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of the Second Change of Control Payment Date, including, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the Second Change of Control Payment Date, subject to the right of Holders of record of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Second Change of Control Payment Date.
If an offer is made to repurchase the Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer pursuant to this Section, the Issuer will comply with all tender offer rules under state and federal securities laws, including, but not limited to, Section 14(e) under the Exchange Act and Rule 14e-1 thereunder, to the extent applicable to such offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Section 14(e) of, and Rule 14e-1 under, the Exchange Act, conflict with the change of control provisions of this Indenture, the Issuer shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the change of control provisions of this Indenture by virtue of such compliance.
A Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of this Indenture, the Notes and/or the Guarantees so long as the tender of Notes by a Holder is not conditioned upon the delivery of consents by such Holder. In addition, the Issuer, the Company or any third party approved in writing by the Issuer that is making the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Alternate Offer) may, subject to applicable law, increase or decrease the Change of Control Payment (or decline to pay any early tender or similar premium) being offered to Holders at any time in its sole discretion, so long as the Change of Control Payment is at least equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon.</div>

              <div class="legal-text">(a)          The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate, directly or indirectly, an Asset Sale (including (x) the sale or issuance of Equity Interests in a Restricted Subsidiary and (y) any Sale Leaseback) unless:
(1)           such Asset Sale is made for Fair Market Value; and
(2)           except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap or a Sale Leaseback, in any such Asset Sale with a purchase price in excess of the greater of (x) $10,000,000 and (y) 5% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended Test Period, at least 75% of the consideration for such Asset Sale, together with all other Asset Sales completed or contractually agreed upon since the Issue Date, received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents.
(b)          Within 450 days after receipt of any Net Proceeds from any Asset Sale (the “Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period”), the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale (the “Applicable Proceeds”),
(1)           to the extent the assets or property disposed of in the Asset Sale constituted Collateral, to repay (i) Obligations under the Notes or (ii) any Additional First Lien Obligations and in each case, in the case of revolving obligations, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto;
(2)           to the extent the assets or property disposed of in the Asset Sale did not constitute Collateral:
(i)           to repay (x) Obligations under the Notes or (y) any Additional First Lien Obligations; or
(ii)          to repay Obligations under any Senior Indebtedness (other than any Senior Indebtedness referred to in clause 4.17(b)(2)(i) above) and in each case, in the case of revolving obligations, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; provided that the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will either (A) reduce the aggregate principal amount of Obligations under the Notes on a ratable basis with any such Senior Indebtedness repaid pursuant to this clause 4.17(b)(2)(ii) by, at its option, (x) redeeming Notes as provided under Article 3 and/or (y) purchasing Notes through open-market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions (which may be below par) and/or (B) make an offer (in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes on a ratable basis with any Senior Indebtedness repaid pursuant to this clause 4.17(b)(2)(ii) for no less than 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon (which offer shall be deemed to be an Asset Sale Offer for purposes hereof); or
(iii)         to repay Obligations under any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor;
(3)           to invest in the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including any acquisition or other Investment permitted under this Indenture); or
(4)           any combination of the foregoing;
provided that, in the case of clause (3) above, a binding commitment or letter of intent shall be treated as a permitted application of the Applicable Proceeds from the date of such commitment or letter of intent so long as the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment or letter of intent with the good faith expectation that such Applicable Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment or letter of intent within 180 days of the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and such Applicable Proceeds are actually applied in such manner within 180 days of the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period (the period from the consummation of the Asset Sale to such date, the “Commitment Application Period”), and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason after the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period and before the Applicable Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, then such Applicable Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds unless the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary reasonably expects to enter into another Acceptable Commitment prior to the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period and such Applicable Proceeds are actually applied in such manner prior to the expiration of the Commitment Application Period. To the extent Applicable Proceeds from an Asset Sale exceed amounts that are invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in Section 4.17(b), such excess amount will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”; provided that any amount of Applicable Proceeds offered to Holders of any Notes pursuant to clause (2) above shall not be deemed to be Excess Proceeds without regard to whether such offer is accepted by any Holders.
If at any time the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $25,000,000, then the Issuer shall within 20 Business Days make an offer to all Holders and, if required or permitted by the terms of any other First Lien Obligations and/or, to the extent that the assets or property disposed of in the Asset Sale were not Collateral, Indebtedness that is pari passu in right of payment with the Notes (“Pari Passu Indebtedness”), to the Holders of such First Lien Obligations and/or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable (an “Asset Sale Offer”), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such First Lien Obligations and/or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, out of the amount of the Excess Proceeds (in the case of any First Lien Obligations and/or Pari Passu Indebtedness, if applicable, is in accordance with the documents governing such First Lien Obligations and/or Pari Passu Indebtedness). The Issuer shall commence an Asset Sale Offer by sending the notice required pursuant to the terms of Section 3.11. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligation with respect to such Applicable Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer in advance of being required to do so by this Indenture (an “Advance Offer”) with respect to all or part of the available Applicable Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”).
(c)          If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and, if applicable, First Lien Obligations and/or Pari Passu Indebtedness, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) (such remaining Excess Proceeds or Advance Portion, as applicable, “Retained Declined Proceeds”) in any manner not prohibited by this Indenture. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion), and in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of Excess Proceeds.
(d)          Pending the final application of an amount equal to the Applicable Proceeds pursuant to this Section 4.17, the holder of such Applicable Proceeds may apply any Applicable Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility or otherwise invest such Applicable Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by this Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may apply any Retained Declined Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by this Indenture and such Retained Declined Proceeds shall in no event and under no circumstances constitute Excess Proceeds.
(e)          Notwithstanding anything in this Indenture to the contrary, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Applicable Proceeds received by a Restricted Subsidiary are prohibited or delayed under any Requirements of Law from being repatriated to the Company, the portion of such Applicable Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this Section 4.17 and shall not constitute Excess Proceeds and may be retained by the applicable Restricted Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the applicable Requirement of Law will not permit repatriation to the Company (the Company hereby agreeing to cause the applicable Restricted Subsidiary to promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable Requirement of Law to permit such repatriation), and once such repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds is permitted under the applicable Requirement of Law, such repatriation will be promptly effected and such repatriated Applicable Proceeds will be promptly applied (net of additional taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) in compliance with this Section 4.17, and (ii) to the extent that and for so long as the Company has determined in good faith that repatriation of any of or all the Applicable Proceeds would have a material adverse tax consequence (taking into account any foreign tax credit or benefit actually realized in connection with such repatriation), the Applicable Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this Section 4.17 and shall not constitute Excess Proceeds and may be retained by the applicable Restricted Subsidiary; provided that when the Company determines in good faith that repatriation of any of or all the Applicable Proceeds received by a Restricted Subsidiary would no longer have a material adverse tax consequence (taking into account any foreign tax credit or benefit actually realized in connection with such repatriation), such Applicable Proceeds shall be promptly applied (net of additional taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) in compliance with this Section 4.17.
(f)          For purposes of clause 4.17(a)(2) of this Section (and no other provision), the following shall be deemed to be cash or Cash Equivalents:
(1)           the greater of the principal amount and carrying value of any liabilities (as reflected on the most recent balance sheet of the Company (or a Parent Entity) provided thereunder or in the footnotes thereto), or if incurred, accrued or increased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on the balance sheet of the Company ((or Parent Entity) or in the footnotes thereto) if such incurrence, accrual or increase had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined in good faith by the Company of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Secured Notes Obligations, that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets (or are otherwise extinguished in connection with the transactions relating to such Asset Sale) pursuant to a written agreement which releases the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from such liabilities;
(2)           any securities received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received) within 180 days following the closing of the applicable Asset Sale; and
(3)           any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary in respect of such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (3) that is at that time outstanding, not in excess (at the time of receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration) of 5% of Consolidated Total Assets for the most recently ended Test Period as of the time of receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration, with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value.
Notwithstanding any of the definitions or covenants contained in this Indenture to the contrary, the Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any transaction that results in the transfer (whether by way of any Restricted Payment, Investment, or any disposition, whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions), directly or indirectly, of the ownership of any Material Intellectual Property to any Unrestricted Subsidiary.
(g)          The Issuer shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the asset sale provisions of this Indenture, the Issuer shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the asset sale provisions of this Indenture by virtue of such compliance.
(h)          The provisions of this Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. An Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of this Indenture, the Notes and/or the Guarantees so long as the tender of the Notes by a Holder is not conditioned upon the delivery of consents by such Holder.</div>

<p><strong>Defaults and Remedies.</strong> Lists the trigger events allowing noteholders to accelerate the Odeon notes. Includes payment defaults, covenant breaches, cross-defaults to other material debt, and bankruptcy events. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Cross-default provisions link the Odeon notes to the broader AMC capital structure. A default at the AMC or Muvico level could trigger acceleration at Odeon, even though the entities and collateral pools are separate.</p>

              <div class="legal-text">(a)           If the Notes are accelerated or otherwise become due prior to the stated maturity of the Notes, in each case, as a result of an Event of Default (including, but not limited to, upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy or insolvency event (including the acceleration of claims by operation of law)), the amount of principal of, accrued and unpaid interest and premium on the Notes that becomes due and payable shall equal the redemption price applicable with respect to an optional redemption of the Notes, in effect on the date of such acceleration as if such acceleration were an optional redemption of the Notes accelerated.
(b)          Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that if the Notes are accelerated or otherwise become due prior to the stated maturity of the Notes, in each case, in respect of any Event of Default (including, but not limited to, upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy or insolvency event (including the acceleration of claims by operation of law)), the premium applicable with respect to an optional redemption of the Notes (which, for all purposes of the paragraphs under this Section, shall be understood to include the applicable redemption price) will also be due and payable as though the Notes were optionally redeemed and shall constitute part of the Obligations, in view of the impracticability and extreme difficulty of ascertaining actual damages and by mutual agreement of the parties as to a reasonable calculation of each holder’s lost profits as a result thereof. Any premium payable above shall be presumed to be the liquidated damages sustained by each holder as the result of the early redemption and the Issuer agrees that it is reasonable under the circumstances currently existing. The premium shall also be payable in the event the Notes (and/or this Indenture) are satisfied or released by foreclosure (whether by power of judicial proceeding), deed in lieu of foreclosure or by any other means. THE ISSUER EXPRESSLY WAIVES (TO THE FULLEST EXTENT IT MAY LAWFULLY DO SO) THE PROVISIONS OF ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE STATUTE OR LAW THAT PROHIBITS OR MAY PROHIBIT THE COLLECTION OF THE FOREGOING PREMIUM IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH ACCELERATION. The Issuer expressly agrees (to the fullest extent it may lawfully do so) that: (A) the premium is reasonable and is the product of an arm’s length transaction between sophisticated business entities, ably represented by counsel; (B) the premium shall be payable notwithstanding the then prevailing market rates at the time payment is made; (C) there has been a course of conduct between holders and the Issuer giving specific consideration in this transaction for such agreement to pay the premium; and (D) the Issuer shall be estopped hereafter from claiming differently than as agreed to in this Section. The Issuer expressly acknowledges that its agreement to pay the premium to Holders as herein described is a material inducement to Holders to purchase the Notes.
(c)           If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(e) or (f)) occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee, by notice to AMC, or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding, by notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, all the Notes to be due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(e) or (f) occurs and is continuing, then the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, all the Notes shall automatically become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. The Trustee shall have no obligation to accelerate the Notes if in the reasonable judgment of the Trustee, acceleration is not in the interest of the Holders.
(d)          At any time after a declaration of acceleration has been made, but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as provided hereinafter in this Article, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
(i)            the Issuer has paid or deposited, or caused to be paid or deposited, with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:
(A)          all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel;
(B)          all overdue interest on all Notes;
(C)          the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Notes that has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate borne by the Notes; and
(D)          to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate borne by the Notes; and
(ii)           all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of principal of the Notes which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 6.04.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
(e)           In the event of a declaration of acceleration in respect of the Notes because an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(d) shall have occurred and be continuing, such declaration of acceleration shall be automatically annulled if the Indebtedness that is the subject of such Event of Default (i) is Indebtedness in the form of an operating lease entered into by the Company or its Subsidiaries after May 21, 1998 and required to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet pursuant to EITF 97-10 or any subsequent pronouncement having similar effect, (ii) has been discharged or the holders thereof have rescinded their declaration of acceleration in respect of such Indebtedness, and (iii) written notice of such discharge or rescission, as the case may be, shall have been given to the Trustee by the Company and countersigned by the holders of such Indebtedness or a trustee, fiduciary or agent for such holders, within 30 days after such declaration of acceleration in respect of the Notes, and no other Event of Default has occurred during such 30-day period which has not been cured or waived during such period.</div>

(b)            Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:
(i)            the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and

However, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein).
(c)            The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:
(i)            this subsection (c) does not limit the effect of subsection (b) of this Section;
(ii)           the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Trust Officer unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
(iii)          the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.05.
(d)           Every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this Section.

(b)            Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officers’ Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on the Officers’ Certificate or Opinion of Counsel.

(j)            Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Indenture, any demand, request, direction or notice from the Issuer or the Company shall be sufficient if signed by an Officer of the Issuer or the Company, as applicable.

The Issuer need not pay for any settlement made by the Trustee without the Issuer’s consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. All indemnifications and releases from liability granted hereunder to the Trustee shall extend to its officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns.
To secure the Issuer’s payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Notes on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee other than money or property held in trust to pay principal of and interest on particular Notes.

(c)            a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
(d)            the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting.
If the Trustee resigns, is removed by the Issuer or by the Holders a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and such Holders do not reasonably promptly appoint a successor Trustee, or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason (the Trustee in such event being referred to herein as the retiring Trustee), the Issuer shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee.
A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Issuer. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07.
If a successor Trustee does not take office within 30 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee or the Holders of 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Note for at least six months may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
Notwithstanding the replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section, the Issuer’s obligations under Section 7.07 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.</div>

<p><strong>Discharge of Indenture; Defeasance.</strong> Specifies how Odeon Finco PLC can satisfy and terminate its obligations through full payment or defeasance. The defeasance mechanism allows the issuer to deposit government securities sufficient to cover all future payments, releasing itself from covenant restrictions. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Given Odeon's 26.67x leverage and 0.29x interest coverage, defeasance is a remote possibility, but the provision defines the path to full satisfaction of the notes.</p>

<p><strong>Discharge of Liability on Notes; Defeasance.</strong> The indenture is discharged when all notes are paid, cancelled, or defeased. Legal defeasance releases the Issuer from all obligations; covenant defeasance releases only from specified covenants. Given Odeon's extreme leverage, defeasance is practically impossible in the near term.</p>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of the Holders of at least 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, no amendment or waiver may (A) make any change in any Security Document or the provisions in this Indenture dealing with Collateral or application of trust proceeds of the Collateral with the effect of releasing the Liens on all or substantially all of the Collateral which secure the Secured Notes Obligations or (B) change or alter the priority of the Liens securing the Secured Notes Obligations in any material portion of the Collateral in any way materially adverse, taken as a whole, to the Holders, other than, in each case, as provided under the terms of this Indenture or the Security Documents.
Upon the request of the Issuer and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 9.06, the Trustee and/or the Security Agent shall join with the Issuer in the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture or security documents or Intercreditor Agreement (provided, that any such intercreditor agreement may reflect that any additional Indebtedness referenced therein has Liens either senior to or junior to the Secured Notes Obligations or any Consolidated First Lien Debt, as applicable, so long as such Liens are permitted under this Indenture, or any joinder with respect to any of the foregoing upon the receipt of an Officer’s Certificate stating that such execution and delivery is permitted by this Indenture and all conditions precedent relating to such execution and delivery have been satisfied) unless such amended or supplemental indenture or security documents or Intercreditor Agreement directly affect the Trustee’s own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental indenture.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
In addition, Holders will be deemed to have consented for purposes of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, and the Security Agent and the Trustee will be authorized, to amend or supplement the Security Documents or enter into a new intercreditor agreement to add additional secured parties to the extent Liens securing Indebtedness and other Obligations held by such parties are permitted under this Indenture.

The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors (collectively, the “Odeon Guarantors”) will, jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guarantee, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Notes and all other obligations and liabilities of the Issuer under this Indenture and the Notes on the terms set forth in this Indenture. Pursuant to the AMC Guarantee, on the Issue Date AMC will, on a standalone basis, fully and unconditionally guarantee, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Notes and all other obligations and liabilities of the Issuer under this Indenture and the Notes on the terms set forth in the AMC Guarantee.
Subject to the provisions of this Article 11, each Odeon Guarantor hereby fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, jointly and severally with each other Odeon Guarantor, to each Holder of the Notes and the Trustee, the full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and all other obligations and liabilities of the Issuer under this Indenture and the Notes (including, without limitation, any interest, fees or expenses accruing subsequent to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, whether or not such interest, fees or expenses is an allowed claim under applicable state, federal or foreign law and the obligations under Section 7.07) (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the “Guarantor Obligations”). Each Odeon Guarantor agrees that the Guarantor Obligations will rank equally in right of payment with other indebtedness of such Odeon Guarantor, except to the extent such other Indebtedness is subordinate to the Guarantor Obligations. Each Odeon Guarantor further agrees (to the extent permitted by law) that the Guarantor Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound under this Article 11 notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guarantor Obligation.
Each Odeon Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of payment from and protest to the Issuer of any of the Guarantor Obligations and also waives notice of protest for non-payment. Each Odeon Guarantor waives notice of any default under the Notes or the Guarantor Obligations.
Each Odeon Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (and not a guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder to any security held for payment of the Guarantor Obligations.
Except as set forth in Section 11.02, the obligations of each Odeon Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than payment of the Guarantor Obligations in full), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guarantor Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Odeon Guarantor herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by (a) the failure of any Holder to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Issuer or any other person under, this Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal granted; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement; (d) the release of any security held by any Holder or the Trustee for the Guarantor Obligations or any of them; (e) the failure of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy against any other Odeon Guarantor; (f) any change in the ownership of the Issuer; (g) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guarantor Obligations; or (h) any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Odeon Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of such Odeon Guarantor as a matter of law or equity.
Subject to the provisions of Section 4.11, each Odeon Guarantor agrees that its Guarantee herein shall remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the Guarantor Obligations or such Odeon Guarantor is released from its Guarantee in compliance with Section 11.03 hereof. Each Odeon Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any of the Guarantor Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Issuer or otherwise.
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder has at law or in equity against any Odeon Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Issuer to pay any of the Guarantor Obligations when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, each Odeon Guarantor hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Holders an amount equal to the sum of (i) the unpaid amount of such Guarantor Obligations then due and owing and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest on such Guarantor Obligations then due and owing (but only to the extent not prohibited by law).
Each Odeon Guarantor further agrees that, as between such Odeon Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the Guarantor Obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in this Indenture for the purposes of its Guarantee herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Guarantor Obligations guaranteed hereby and (y) in the event of any such declaration of acceleration of such Guarantor Obligations, such Guarantor Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Odeon Guarantor for the purposes of this Guarantee.
Each Odeon Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee or the Holders in enforcing any rights under this Section.</div>

The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of any Guarantee set forth in this Indenture on behalf of each Odeon Guarantor.</div>

<p><strong>Collateral.</strong> Governs the security documents, Security Agent's role, lien release conditions, and intercreditor arrangements. These notes hold 1L priority on Odeon's assets. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The collateral is exclusively Odeon-level assets (European cinemas and related property). The "Agreed Security Principles" in Exhibit D govern how security interests are taken across multiple European jurisdictions, each with different real property and corporate law regimes. The Security Agent (not "Collateral Agent") terminology reflects UK practice.</p>

<p><strong>Security Agent.</strong> Detailed provisions governing the Security Agent's appointment, powers, duties, and limitations. The Security Agent role is more extensive than the US "Collateral Agent" concept, reflecting the multi-jurisdictional nature of the collateral and the Agreed Security Principles framework. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The Security Agent coordinates collateral enforcement across the UK, Germany, Spain, Italy, and other markets, each with different legal procedures.</p>

              <div class="legal-text">(a)            The Issuer and each of the Holders by acceptance of the Notes hereby designates and appoints the Security Agent as its agent under this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer and each of the Holders by acceptance of the Notes hereby irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Security Agent by the terms of this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, and consents and agrees to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and each Security Document, as the same may be in effect or may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with their respective terms. The Security Agent agrees to act as such on the express conditions contained in this Section 12.07. Each Holder agrees that any action taken by the Security Agent in accordance with the provision of this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, and the exercise by the Security Agent of any rights or remedies set forth herein and therein shall be authorized and binding upon all Holders. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the duties of the Security Agent shall be ministerial and administrative in nature, and the Security Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein and in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement to which the Security Agent is a party, nor shall the Security Agent have or be deemed to have any trust or other fiduciary relationship with the Trustee, any Holder or any Grantor, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or otherwise exist against the Security Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term “agent” in this Indenture with reference to the Security Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.
(b)            The Security Agent may perform any of its duties under this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement by or through receivers, agents, employees, attorneys-in-fact or with respect to any specified Person, such Person’s Affiliates, and the respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and attorneys-in-fact of such Person and its Affiliates (a “Related Person”), and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties, and shall be entitled to act upon, and shall be fully protected in taking action in reliance upon any advice or opinion given by legal counsel. The Security Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any receiver, agent, employee, attorney-in-fact or Related Person that it selects as long as such selection was made in good faith and with due care.
(c)            None of the Security Agent or any of its respective Related Persons shall (i) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Indenture or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or under or in connection with any Security Document or the Intercreditor Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of the Trustee or any Holder for any recital, statement, representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Issuer or any other Grantor or Affiliate of any Grantor, or any Officer or Related Person thereof, contained in this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Security Agent under or in connection with, this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement, or for any failure of any Grantor or any other party to this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. None of the Security Agent or any of its respective Related Persons shall be under any obligation to the Trustee or any Holder to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or to inspect the properties, books, or records of any Grantor or any Grantor’s Affiliates.
(d)            The Security Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, certification, telephone message, statement, or other communication, document or conversation (including those by telephone or e-mail) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent, or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to the Issuer or any other Grantor), independent accountants and other experts and advisors selected by the Security Agent. The Security Agent shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, or other paper or document. The Security Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Trustee or the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes as it determines and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Holders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Security Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with a request, direction, instruction or consent of the Trustee or the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Holders.
(e)            The Security Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, unless a Responsible Officer of the Security Agent shall have received written notice from the Trustee or the Issuer referring to this Indenture, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default.” The Security Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be requested by the Trustee in accordance with Article 6 or the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes (subject to this Section 12.07).
(f)            The Security Agent may resign at any time by notice to the Trustee and the Issuer, such resignation to be effective upon the acceptance of a successor agent to its appointment as Security Agent. If the Security Agent resigns under this Indenture, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Security Agent. If no successor Security Agent is appointed prior to the intended effective date of the resignation of the Security Agent (as stated in the notice of resignation), the Trustee, at the direction of the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, may appoint a successor Security Agent, subject to the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and which shall not be required during a continuing Event of Default). If no successor Security Agent is appointed and consented to by the Company pursuant to the preceding sentence within thirty (30) days after the intended effective date of resignation (as stated in the notice of resignation) the Security Agent shall be entitled to petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor Security Agent hereunder, such successor Security Agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Security Agent, and the term “Security Agent” shall mean such successor Security Agent, and the retiring Security Agent’s appointment, powers and duties as the Security Agent shall be terminated. After the retiring Security Agent’s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Section 12.07 shall continue to inure to its benefit and the retiring Security Agent shall not by reason of such resignation be deemed to be released from liability as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Security Agent under this Indenture.
(g)            The Trustee shall initially act as Security Agent and shall be authorized to appoint co-Security Agents as necessary in its sole discretion. Except as otherwise explicitly provided herein or in the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement, neither the Security Agent nor any of its respective officers, directors, employees or agents or other Related Persons shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part thereof. The Security Agent shall be accountable only for amounts that it actually receives as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither the Security Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
(h)            The Security Agent is authorized and directed to (i) enter into the Security Documents to which it is party, whether executed on or after the Issue Date, (ii) enter into the Intercreditor Agreement, including joinders and supplements thereto, whether executed on or after the Issue Date, (iii) make the representations of the Holders set forth in the Security Documents and Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) bind the Holders on the terms as set forth in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and (v) perform and observe its obligations under the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement.
(i)            If at any time or times the Trustee shall receive (i) by payment, foreclosure, set-off or otherwise, any proceeds of Collateral or any payments with respect to the Obligations arising under, or relating to, this Indenture, except for any such proceeds or payments received by the Trustee from the Security Agent pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, or (ii) payments from the Security Agent in excess of the amount required to be paid to the Trustee pursuant to Article 6, the Trustee shall promptly turn the same over to the Security Agent, in kind, and with such endorsements as may be required to negotiate the same to the Security Agent such proceeds to be applied by the Security Agent pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement.
(j)            The Security Agent is each Holder’s agent for the purpose of perfecting the Holders’ security interest in assets which, in accordance with Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code can be perfected only by possession. Should the Trustee obtain possession of any such Collateral, upon request from the Issuer, the Trustee shall notify the Security Agent thereof and promptly shall deliver such Collateral to the Security Agent or otherwise deal with such Collateral in accordance with the Security Agent’s instructions.
(k)            The Security Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to the Trustee or any of the Holders to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by any Grantor or is cared for, protected, or insured or has been encumbered, or that the Security Agent’s Liens have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected, maintained or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to determine whether all of the Grantor’s property constituting Collateral intended to be subject to the Lien and security interest of the Security Documents has been properly and completely listed or delivered, as the case may be, or the genuineness, validity, marketability or sufficiency thereof or title thereto, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities, and powers granted or available to the Security Agent pursuant to this Indenture, any Security Document or the Intercreditor Agreement other than pursuant to the instructions of the Trustee or the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes or as otherwise provided in the Security Documents.
(l)            If the Issuer or any Odeon Guarantor (i) incurs any obligations in respect of junior priority obligations at any time when no Additional Intercreditor Agreement is in effect and (ii) delivers to the Security Agent an Officers’ Certificate so stating and requesting the Security Agent to enter into any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in favor of a designated agent or representative for the holders of the junior priority obligations so incurred, the Security Agent shall (and is hereby authorized and directed to) enter into such intercreditor agreement (at the sole expense and cost of the Issuer, including legal fees and expenses of the Security Agent), bind the Holders on the terms set forth therein and perform and observe its obligations thereunder; provided that neither an Officer’s Certificate nor an Opinion of Counsel shall be required pursuant to this Section 12.07(l) in connection with the applicable Intercreditor Agreement (including pursuant to a joinder thereto) to be entered into.
(m)            No provision of this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document shall require the Security Agent (or the Trustee) to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or thereunder or to take or omit to take any action hereunder or thereunder or take any action at the request or direction of Holders (or the Trustee in the case of the Security Agent) unless it shall have received indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Security Agent and the Trustee against potential costs and liabilities incurred by the Security Agent relating thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, in the event the Security Agent is entitled or required to commence an action to foreclose or otherwise exercise its remedies to acquire control or possession of the Collateral, the Security Agent shall not be required to commence any such action or exercise any remedy or to inspect or conduct any studies of any property under the mortgages or take any such other action if the Security Agent has determined that the Security Agent may incur personal liability as a result of the presence at, or release on or from, the Collateral or such property, of any hazardous substances. The Security Agent shall at any time be entitled to cease taking any action described in this clause if it no longer reasonably deems any indemnity, security or undertaking from the Issuer or the Holders to be sufficient.
(n)            The Security Agent (i) shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in connection with this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents or instrument referred to herein or therein, except to the extent that any of the foregoing are found by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its own gross negligence or willful misconduct, (ii) shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Security Agent may agree in writing with the Issuer (and money held in trust by the Security Agent need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law) and (iii) may consult with counsel of its selection and the advice or opinion of such counsel as to matters of law shall be full and complete authorization and protection from liability in respect of any action taken, omitted or suffered by it in good faith and in accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel. The grant of permissive rights or powers to the Security Agent shall not be construed to impose duties to act.
(o)            Neither the Security Agent nor the Trustee shall be liable for delays or failures in performance resulting from acts beyond its control. Such acts shall include but not be limited to acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war, epidemics, governmental regulations superimposed after the fact, fire, communication line failures, computer viruses, power failures, earthquakes or other disasters. Neither the Security Agent nor the Trustee shall be liable for any indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages (included but not limited to lost profits) whatsoever, even if it has been informed of the likelihood thereof and regardless of the form of action.
(p)            The Security Agent does not assume any responsibility for any failure or delay in performance or any breach by the Issuer or any other Grantor under this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. The Security Agent shall not be responsible to the Holders or any other Person for any recitals, statements, information, representations or warranties contained in this Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or in any certificate, report, statement, or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Security Agent under or in connection with, this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document; the execution, validity, genuineness, effectiveness or enforceability of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Security Documents of any other party thereto; the genuineness, enforceability, collectability, value, sufficiency, location or existence of any Collateral, or the validity, effectiveness, enforceability, sufficiency, extent, perfection or priority of any Lien therein; the validity, enforceability or collectability of any Obligations; the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, business, creditworthiness or legal status of any obligor; or for any failure of any obligor to perform its Obligations under this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. The Security Agent shall have no obligation to any Holder or any other Person to ascertain or inquire into the existence of any Default or Event of Default, the observance or performance by any obligor of any terms of this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, or the satisfaction of any conditions precedent contained in this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Security Documents. The Security Agent shall not be required to initiate or conduct any litigation or collection or other proceeding under this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents unless expressly set forth hereunder or thereunder. The Security Agent shall have the right at any time to seek instructions from the Holders with respect to the administration of this Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement.
(q)            The parties hereto and the Holders hereby agree and acknowledge that neither the Security Agent nor the Trustee shall assume, be responsible for or otherwise be obligated for any liabilities, claims, causes of action, suits, losses, allegations, requests, demands, penalties, fines, settlements, damages (including foreseeable and unforeseeable), judgments, expenses and costs (including but not limited to, any remediation, corrective action, response, removal or remedial action, or investigation, operations and maintenance or monitoring costs, for personal injury or property damages, real or personal) of any kind whatsoever, pursuant to any environmental law as a result of this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents or any actions taken pursuant hereto or thereto. Further, the parties hereto and the Holders hereby agree and acknowledge that in the exercise of its rights under this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, the Security Agent may hold or obtain indicia of ownership primarily to protect the security interest of the Security Agent in the Collateral and that any such actions taken by the Security Agent shall not be construed as or otherwise constitute any participation in the management of such Collateral. In the event that the Security Agent or the Trustee is required to acquire title to an asset for any reason, or take any managerial action of any kind in regard thereto, in order to carry out any fiduciary or trust obligation for the benefit of another, which in the Security Agent or the Trustee’s sole discretion may cause the Security Agent or the Trustee to be considered an “owner or operator” under the provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), 42 U.S.C. §9601, et seq., or otherwise cause the Security Agent or the Trustee to incur liability under CERCLA or any other federal, state or local law, the Security Agent and the Trustee reserves the right, instead of taking such action, to either resign as the Security Agent or the Trustee or arrange for the transfer of the title or control of the asset to a court-appointed receiver. Neither the Security Agent nor the Trustee shall be liable to the Issuer, the Odeon Guarantors or any other Person for any environmental claims or contribution actions under any federal, state or local law, rule or regulation by reason of the Security Agent or the Trustee’s actions and conduct as authorized, empowered and directed hereunder or relating to the discharge, release or threatened release of hazardous materials into the environment. If at any time it is necessary or advisable for property to be possessed, owned, operated or managed by any Person (including the Security Agent or the Trustee) other than the Issuer or the Odeon Guarantors, a majority in interest of Holders shall direct the Security Agent or the Trustee to appoint an appropriately qualified Person (excluding the Security Agent or the Trustee) who they shall designate to possess, own, operate or manage, as the case may be, the property.
(r)            Upon the receipt by the Security Agent of a written request of the Issuer signed by an Officer (a “Security Document Order”), the Security Agent is hereby authorized to execute and enter into, and shall execute and enter into, without the further consent of any Holder or the Trustee, any Security Document or amendment or supplement thereto, to be executed after the Issue Date. Such Security Document Order shall (i) state that it is being delivered to the Security Agent pursuant to, and is a Security Document Order referred to in, this Section 12.07(r), and (ii) instruct the Security Agent to execute and enter into such Security Document or amendment or supplement thereto. Any such execution of a Security Document or amendment or supplement thereto shall be at the direction and expense of the Issuer, upon delivery to the Security Agent of an Officer’s Certificate stating that all conditions precedent to the execution and delivery of the Security Document or amendment or supplement thereto have been satisfied. The Holders, by their acceptance of the Notes, hereby authorize and direct the Security Agent to execute such Security Documents or amendment or supplement thereto.
(s)            Subject to the provisions of the applicable Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, each Holder, by acceptance of the Notes, agrees that the Security Agent shall execute and deliver the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents to which it is a party and all agreements, documents and instruments incidental thereto, and act in accordance with the terms thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the Security Agent shall have no discretion under this Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents and shall not be required to make or give any determination, consent, approval, request or direction without the written direction of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes or the Trustee, as applicable.
(t)            After the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee, acting at the direction of the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, may direct the Security Agent in connection with any action required or permitted by this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement.
(u)            The Security Agent is authorized to receive any funds for the benefit of itself, the Trustee and the Holders distributed under the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement and to the extent not prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement, for turnover to the Trustee to make further distributions of such funds to itself, the Trustee and the Holders in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.10 and the other provisions of this Indenture.
(v)            In each case that the Security Agent may or is required hereunder or under any Security Document or any Intercreditor Agreement to take any action (an “Action”), including without limitation to make any determination, to give consents, to exercise rights, powers or remedies, to release or sell Collateral or otherwise to act hereunder or under any Security Document or any Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent may seek direction from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes. The Security Agent shall not be liable with respect to any Action taken or omitted to be taken by it in accordance with the direction from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes. If the Security Agent shall request direction from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes with respect to any Action, the Security Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such Action unless and until the Security Agent shall have received direction from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, and the Security Agent shall not incur liability to any Person by reason of so refraining.
(w)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture or in any Security Document or any Intercreditor Agreement, in no event shall the Security Agent or the Trustee be responsible for, or have any duty or obligation with respect to, the recording, filing, registering, perfection, protection or maintenance of the security interests or Liens intended to be created by this Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement (including without limitation the filing or continuation of any UCC financing or continuation statements or similar documents or instruments), nor shall the Security Agent or the Trustee be responsible for, and neither the Security Agent nor the Trustee makes any representation regarding, the validity, effectiveness or priority of any of the Security Documents or the security interests or Liens intended to be created thereby.
(x)            Before the Security Agent acts or refrains from acting in each case at the request or direction of the Issuer or the Odeon Guarantors, it may require an Officer’s Certificate, which shall conform to the provisions of this Section 12.07 and Sections 13.04 and 13.05; provided that no Officer’s Certificate shall be required in connection with the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement to be entered by the Security Agent on the Issue Date. The Security Agent shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on such certificate.
(y)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Security Agent shall act pursuant to the instructions of the Holders and the Trustee solely with respect to the Security Documents and the Collateral.
(z)            The rights, privileges, benefits, immunities, indemnities and other protections given to the Trustee are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Security Agent as if the Security Agent were named as the Trustee herein and the Security Documents were named as this Indenture herein.
(aa)      The Issuer and the Odeon Guarantors shall furnish to the Trustee and the Security Agent, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (beginning with the first fiscal year ending after the Issue Date and after giving effect to any fiscal year end change effected on or after the Issue Date), an Officer’s Certificate (which may be the same certificate required to be delivered by the Issuer pursuant to Section 4.14) either (i) (x) stating that such action has been taken with respect to the recording, filing, re-recording, and refiling of this Indenture or the Security Documents, as applicable, as are necessary to maintain the perfected Liens of the applicable Security Documents securing the Obligations under applicable law to the extent required by the Security Documents other than any action as described therein to be taken, and (y) stating that on the date of such Officer’s Certificate, all financing statements, financing statement amendments and continuation statements have been or will be executed and filed that are necessary, as of such date or promptly thereafter and during the succeeding 12 months, fully to maintain the perfection (to the extent required by the Security Documents) of the security interests of the Security Agent securing the Obligations thereunder and under the Security Documents with respect to the Collateral; provided that if there is a required filing of a continuation statement or other instrument within such 12-month period and such continuation statement or amendment is not effective if filed at the time of the Officer’s Certificate, such Officer’s Certificate may so state and in that case the Issuer and the Odeon Guarantors shall cause a continuation statement or amendment to be timely filed and become effective so as to maintain such Liens and security interests securing Obligations or (ii) stating that no such action is necessary to maintain such Liens or security interests.
(bb)      In the event of a conflict of inconsistency between the terms of this Section 12.07 and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement shall control.</div>

<p><strong>Additional Intercreditor Agreements.</strong> Provides for the Issuer to enter into intercreditor agreements with future creditors, establishing priority rules among different tranches of Odeon-level debt. <strong>Why it matters:</strong> If Odeon incurs additional secured debt within permitted baskets, this provision governs how the new creditors' liens relate to the existing noteholders' 1L position.</p>

At the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries or Guarantors to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes) and the Guarantees, (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, except as otherwise permitted under Section [9.02], and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under this Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
In relation to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with Section 4.07.</div>

Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to the Holder at the Holder’s address as it appears on the registration books of the Registrar and shall be sufficiently given if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it.
All notices, approvals, consents, requests and any communications under this Indenture must be in writing (provided that any communication sent to the Trustee must be in the form of a document that is signed manually or by way of a digital signature provided by DocuSign (or such other digital signature provider as specified in writing to the Trustee by the Issuer)), in English.
