                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Section 4.05 -- Limitation on Consolidated Indebtedness:</strong> Previously capped how much total debt AMC could take on. Without this, AMC can borrow unlimited amounts senior to these notes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Section 4.06 -- Limitation on Restricted Payments:</strong> Previously blocked AMC from paying dividends, buying back stock, or transferring value to equity holders while debt was outstanding. Without this, cash can flow to shareholders ahead of bondholders.</li>
                    <li><strong>Section 4.07 -- Limitation on Liens:</strong> Previously restricted AMC's ability to pledge assets as collateral for other debt. Without this, AMC can encumber all assets with senior liens, pushing these bondholders further back in line.</li>
                    <li><strong>Section 4.08 -- Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates:</strong> Previously prevented self-dealing -- AMC couldn't transfer assets to related parties at below-market prices. Without this, value can be moved away from bondholders.</li>
                    <li><strong>Section 4.09 -- Limitation on Senior Subordinated Indebtedness:</strong> Previously restricted AMC from issuing more debt at the same level. Without this, these notes can be diluted by unlimited new same-priority debt.</li>
                    <li><strong>Section 4.10 -- Future Guarantors:</strong> Previously required new subsidiaries to guarantee these notes. Without this, AMC can park assets in new subsidiaries beyond bondholders' reach.</li>
                    <li><strong>Section 4.11 -- Change of Control:</strong> Previously required AMC to offer to repurchase the notes at 101% if there was a change of control. Without this, the company can be sold without giving bondholders an exit.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>All seven sections are replaced with <strong>"[Intentionally Omitted]"</strong> -- legal language confirming they were deliberately erased, not accidentally forgotten.</p>

                  <p>The original merger covenant (Section 5.01) had multiple conditions AMC had to meet before merging or consolidating with another entity. The revised version strips it down to only <strong>two requirements</strong>:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Obligation Assumption:</strong> If AMC merges into another entity, that entity must formally assume AMC's obligations under the notes (so there's still someone on the hook for the debt).</li>
                    <li><strong>Officer's Certificate + Opinion of Counsel:</strong> AMC just needs to deliver a signed certificate from an officer and a lawyer's letter saying the merger complies. This is a <strong>self-certification</strong> -- essentially AMC vouching for itself.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>What was removed:</strong> The original Section 5.01 likely required that after the merger, the surviving entity had to meet financial tests (e.g., no more leveraged than before), pass a "no default" test, and maintain certain coverage ratios. Those substantive protections are gone. Now AMC can merge with anything, as long as the new entity formally assumes the debt and AMC's own officer signs off.</p>

                  <p>If a court strikes down any single provision of this amendment as invalid or unenforceable, <strong>the rest of the amendment survives</strong>. This is a critical defensive clause: even if a bondholder successfully challenges one part of the covenant strip (say, the guarantee release), the other deletions (covenants, events of default) still stand. Each destruction is independent.</p>

                    <li>The Trustee agrees to perform its duties under the amended Indenture, but <strong>only on the same terms and protections</strong> it had before -- including all limits on its liability.</li>
                    <li>The Trustee <strong>makes no representation about whether this amendment is valid, fair, or proper</strong>.

                <div class="translation-text">
                  <p>This clause has a crucial two-step timing mechanism:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>The amendment itself is effective immediately</strong> upon signing on July 27, 2020.</li>
                    <li><strong>But the actual covenant changes (Article I) only kick in</strong> when the <span class="defined-term" data-term="Exchange Offer">Exchange Offer</span> is consummated -- meaning when the new 10%/12% PIK Toggle notes are actually issued and the old notes surrendered.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>This protects AMC: if the exchange fell through, the covenant strip wouldn't take effect. But once the exchange closed, the strip became permanent and irrevocable. AMC was required to notify the <span class="defined-term" data-term="Trustee">Trustee</span> when the exchange was completed (or if it was abandoned).</p>
                  <p>AMC also <strong>represents and certifies</strong> to the Trustee that the majority consent threshold was met. This is another self-certification -- the Trustee relies on AMC's word rather than independently counting votes.</p>

                  <p>This four-page document represents one of the most aggressive covenant-stripping transactions in the history of high-yield debt. Here is the total damage:</p>

                  <p><strong>Covenants Deleted (7 of 7):</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Limitation on Indebtedness -- AMC can now borrow unlimited amounts ahead of these notes</li>
                    <li>Restricted Payments -- Cash can flow to equity holders at will</li>
                    <li>Limitation on Liens -- All assets can be pledged to other creditors</li>
                    <li>Affiliate Transactions -- Self-dealing is unrestricted</li>
                    <li>Senior Subordinated Debt Limitation -- Unlimited dilution at this level</li>
                    <li>Future Guarantors -- No new subsidiaries will ever guarantee these notes</li>
                    <li>Change of Control -- No put right if the company is sold</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><strong>Events of Default Deleted (6 of ~10):</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Cross-default, judgment default, guarantee invalidity, subsidiary bankruptcy, and covenant breach triggers -- all gone</li>
                    <li>Only payment default and company-level bankruptcy remain as triggers</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><strong>Guarantees Released:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>All subsidiary guarantees immediately terminated</li>
                    <li>These notes went from a claim against the entire AMC enterprise to an unsecured, unguaranteed claim against the holding company</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><strong>Merger Covenant Gutted:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>AMC can merge into any entity with only self-certification, no financial health tests</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><strong>Strategic Purpose:</strong> This cleared the path for AMC's 2020 restructuring. The exchanging holders got new <strong>10%/12% Second Lien Secured Notes</strong> with actual collateral. The holdouts were left with a covenant-free, guarantee-free unsecured instrument against a company in severe financial distress during COVID-19. This is the textbook "exit consent" playbook.</p>
